&lt;h3 data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;Episode Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:00] Johnny: I'm afraid because I know when the, the five, six, seven, eight comes and the lights are there and the [00:00:05] action and the audience. And you have to open your mouth and it has to be there. And that pressure. I'm like, if we [00:00:10] put the, the big note at the end of the defying gravity as the goal, it has to be scored every night.[00:00:15] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:15] Johnny: Every single night. It has to be because the second that you don't score it. [00:00:20] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:21] Claire: So take us back to the beginning. Where did it start? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:24] Johnny: [00:00:25] I started watching Michael Jackson at the age of four, and I, I remember [00:00:30] watching tapes like over and over and over, and I remember saying to my mom, I was like. Pointing at the stage and [00:00:35] going like, this is, this is what I want to do.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:36] Claire: Introducing Johnny Bishop, from a dream of being in The Lion King as a kid, to [00:00:40] starring in some of the biggest West End shows like Moulin Rouge!, Hamilton, and In the Heights, and has appeared on [00:00:45] film in The Little Mermaid and Mary Poppins Returns. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:47] Johnny: I think there's definitely something about being on [00:00:50] stage.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:50] Johnny: I know that something comes alive. It's almost like you're like, soaring. It just [00:00:55] The thing opens up and you're there. I think I also have this thing in my mind where it's [00:01:00] possible. If, if they can do it, I can do it because they're not an alien. They're human. I [00:01:05] remember the things open and the audience were just like, they just went, [00:01:10] wow.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:10] Johnny: So I'm in this pose like this and I'm like, oh my Jesus. Like, I just hope that I hit [00:01:15] this note. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:15] Oren: Hello and welcome to the five minute call. This is a podcast where we take a deep dive [00:01:20] into the stories of the people that make theatre happen. Today we are talking to [00:01:25] Jonny Bishop. Jonny has been in the original London cast of Moulin Rouge, [00:01:30] the original London cast of Hamilton, In the Heights and The Lion King.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:34] Claire: Jonny's also [00:01:35] appeared on film in The Little Mermaid and Mary Poppins Returns. So [00:01:40] we're very interested in your story and we know you didn't start in London. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:43] Johnny: Yes, that's [00:01:45] right. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:45] Claire: So take us back to the beginning. Where does it start? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:47] Johnny: The beginning, in the [00:01:50] beginning, once upon a time. Um, so I grew up in [00:01:55] Trinidad until I was 10 and I moved here to London at 10.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:59] Johnny: I [00:02:00] started watching Michael Jackson at the age of four. But just before that, [00:02:05] actually, I I really love the Spice Girls and my, my parents were [00:02:10] like, we need to get him like a guy that he could like look at. So [00:02:15] my mom was like, she said to my dad, she was like, um, please, can you get like some, you know, [00:02:20] videotapes or whatever?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:02:21] Johnny: So he went and got Michael Jackson. And then I was like, [00:02:25] Wow. And I, I remember watching the TV like over and over and over. I just used [00:02:30] to play his tapes like over and over and over, uh, the Motown, uh, [00:02:35] performance in Motown 25, which he was doing Billie Jean. And then eventually I got all the costumes [00:02:40] and everything, and I had like the sparkly jacket, the sparkly socks, like I've been full out from a [00:02:45] very young age, always doing the most.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:02:46] Johnny: And it's all on, on like my request. I want this. I want that. I [00:02:50] want this. Basically, I took part in a competition. called 12 and Under, which is [00:02:55] for basically kids who want to perform. And the funny story is my mom, when she [00:03:00] was younger, she performed on it. So once they saw that I was like, sort of getting into [00:03:05] this, they were like, great.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:03:06] Johnny: My grandmother was like, Oh, take him on the show. So my mom was [00:03:10] like, okay, fine. We'll dress you up. We'll rehearse you. And my mom was like my choreographer. [00:03:15] Even though she's not like a choreographer or dancer, but she used to watch me and she'd be like, you keep doing the same [00:03:20] moves. You have to do more than, than this.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:03:23] Johnny: And also Michael in, [00:03:25] in that Motown 25 performance, he is singing as well. So [00:03:30] he's not only dancing. I was just going to dance. So she was like, you have to do more than what he was doing. [00:03:35] So we would sit there and she would write down the moves because this is how she would best knew to choreograph [00:03:40] things.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:03:40] Johnny: So she's like, okay, you're going to do a slow turn. Then you do the step, step, step. So, [00:03:45] We got that, we did that. And then I came first in the competition, which was really fun. [00:03:50] And then I went to, I'm, I was like four [00:03:55] when I was practicing. And then I must've been like six, five, [00:04:00] six or seven, maybe. So I came first and then, and then I got to the finals and I actually, I [00:04:05] think I came second or something like that.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:04:07] Johnny: And then from that point onwards, I think they were like, [00:04:10] Oh, this is good for you. Let's, let's sort of, um, You know, push [00:04:15] you in this and see if we can support you. So then a show from [00:04:20] London, um, called Carnival Messiah came to Trinidad and [00:04:25] the lady that produced it, uh, she lived in Leeds, uh, but she was a [00:04:30] Trinidadian.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:04:30] Johnny: So when she came, she brought some people from Leeds and then she [00:04:35] also hired a bunch of locals. And this is where it kind of, the story kind of really began. Pushes off. [00:04:40] Uh, I got into the show. My aunt was the costume designer on the show. So [00:04:45] she lives over here and she was like, I think you should, to my mom, you know, let him come to the audition.[00:04:50] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:04:50] Johnny: I think the show would be great for him. So I go into the audition. I, I get in and [00:04:55] basically I was just a kid running around the stage having a blast, but we would have like, 10 [00:05:00] hour rehearsals and stuff. Cause there was a lot of people and I would get home and be like, [00:05:05] I want to do it again. Like I want to go back like now, you know?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:05:08] Johnny: So this, I loved it. [00:05:10] And I remember saying to my mom, I was like pointing at the stage and going like, this is, this is like what I want to do. [00:05:15] And because there were some people from, uh, the UK that were in the show, [00:05:20] they were like, you know what? You should, um, you should audition for some [00:05:25] schools out here.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:05:26] Johnny: In London. So, and then the thing is my, [00:05:30] my, um, I know I'm jumping around, but it all makes time to try and tie it back together. But my, my [00:05:35] dad's dad is British or was British because he passed now. But, um, [00:05:40] so in that way I had like a British passport and my aunt lived here. So it was, I had [00:05:45] like these two sort of lucky stars if the, um, sort of ways that actually it [00:05:50] could work if I actually got in to a school.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:05:54] Johnny: So once [00:05:55] that show finished, um, Lion King came to audition [00:06:00] and Pippa came and she was auditioning for adults. But [00:06:05] because I was like a child performer at the time, I know there aren't any boys doing this at that [00:06:10] time in Trinidad. So I was probably one of like three boys. So then, [00:06:15] uh, I get into the room somehow because they're like, you have to see him.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:06:19] Johnny: [00:06:20] He's a little child. He's, you know, wants to do it. And I love Lion King. That was another thing I used to watch on repeat. [00:06:25] And so I went in dressed as Michael Jackson to a Lion King audition, which is just like, [00:06:30] I can just imagine it. It's just like, what's happening? You know, it [00:06:35] just, yeah, it's just like, just doing too much from the beginning.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:06:39] Johnny: Anyway, [00:06:40] you know, so then she, I remember Pippa was like, looking, just like, What's happening? So then [00:06:45] she tells me, okay, the next time you need to come like, you know, a bit simpler, but just, yeah. [00:06:50] So a year goes by, she comes back and then I end up going back to the audition, [00:06:55] this time in like just a t shirt, some shorts and a sandals.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:06:58] Johnny: And then she says, she's like, you know, [00:07:00] I guess that like they were happy with what I was doing, but you can't, [00:07:05] We can take adults from here, but we can't take kids. So, you should really [00:07:10] go to this school, Sylvia Young. She recommended, I think it was that and maybe [00:07:15] another school. And you need to be on an agency in London.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:07:19] Johnny: And [00:07:20] so, it took like a couple of years, sort of me begging my parents. I was like, You guys are holding me back, like, I want to go, [00:07:25] I want to go, I want to go. And they're like, what do we do with this child? Like, what's, what's happening? And my, I have an older [00:07:30] brother, brilliant, you know, like typical, but he, he's so like, [00:07:35] he's intelligent.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:07:35] Johnny: He has the brains and then very sporty. So football and all these things. [00:07:40] And I told my mom, I was like, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do the sports. I don't want to do [00:07:45] the football and the thing. And I, this is what I want to do. So [00:07:50] eventually they were like, okay. She started calling around, we got the [00:07:55] audition for Sylvia's.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:07:56] Johnny: In Trinidad, we have primary school, and then we have standard one, [00:08:00] standard two, three, four, and five. And in five, you write your exam to go into secondary [00:08:05] school. What do you guys call that, like, do you call, I mean, uh [00:08:10] We &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:08:10] Claire: have SATs. SAT, right. In year six, yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:08:12] Johnny: So SAT. Our one is called [00:08:15] Common Entrance. Okay.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:08:15] Johnny: So I ended up missing that because it fell on the same [00:08:20] day as my audition for Sylvia's. And I remember saying, [00:08:25] apparently, like the story goes, my mom tells me this story, that I told my brother, I saw him [00:08:30] studying one time, and he was older than me, so he was already past the SAT, he was in [00:08:35] secondary school.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:08:35] Johnny: And I saw him studying all this stuff and I was like, I'm not gonna do that. And my mom was like, [00:08:40] yes, you are, you're going to write the exam. And then it happened that the exact same day as my [00:08:45] exam was my audition. So I came over, I did the audition and [00:08:50] then I got a recall. So I think I had to come back.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:08:52] Johnny: And then what I did was I wrote my exam [00:08:55] further down the line. So the teachers had to like reteach me back at Trinidad, which they weren't actually [00:09:00] very happy about. If I, yeah, they, they weren't. Yeah. Cause that's, that's [00:09:05] the other thing, you know, because we were, you know, Because I think that the culture there is very academic [00:09:10] driven.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:11] Johnny: Um, I think at first there wasn't that much support for what [00:09:15] I was doing. And then I think my parents got quite a bit of flack, probably from [00:09:20] different sides. Some people were in support because they were like, Oh yeah, you know, he's doing [00:09:25] good stuff. And, but yeah, it was kind of a bit tricky at that point, but.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:29] Claire: Huge thing for [00:09:30] them to do. Yeah. Huge thing for them to support. And also kind of [00:09:35] incredible that you knew your mind so clearly. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:38] Johnny: That's about that. Yeah. I don't know. [00:09:40] I, &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:40] Claire: I knew I wanted to sing when I was eight, like no, no question. So I, I can find [00:09:45] that in me, but I think I, I don't think I would have known it [00:09:50] so clearly to go, yeah, I can leave my family and travel.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:52] Claire: Well, this is it. Yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:54] Johnny: [00:09:55] It's weird, isn't it? Yeah, I don't I, cause yeah, when I look back on that part of [00:10:00] me, it's, it's yeah, in some ways it is not a different identity, but it's like the [00:10:05] child version of me was very brave, very [00:10:10] just like, and it wasn't like, um, proud or anything. It was just, that's what I [00:10:15] want.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:10:15] Johnny: Here we go. And I'm going for it. And, and yes, mommy, I love you. Daddy, I love [00:10:20] you, but I need to go. And so I remember them sort of being like, [00:10:25] Oh God. So I did get into the school and then my mom and dad were like, okay, [00:10:30] to my aunt, can you come live with you? She's like, great. Fantastic. But again, [00:10:35] everything was a sacrifice.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:10:36] Johnny: So my brother stayed in Trinidad. I came to live with [00:10:40] my aunt. Um, I lived in their living room. So it's not like a big, it's like a, [00:10:45] Council flat, you know, so like, and my cousin was in the other room and they, [00:10:50] my aunt and uncle stayed in the other room. I lived there for many years and I, I think [00:10:55] we were always sacrificing at different levels to sort of make, make it [00:11:00] work.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:11:00] Johnny: I went to school here and it was, I loved it. I [00:11:05] loved it. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:11:05] Claire: Tell us about life. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:11:07] Johnny: At theatre school. At theatre school. What was that like? [00:11:10] Brilliant. Some people, I, do you know what, the thing is, some people didn't, didn't enjoy it, but I loved it [00:11:15] because the main thing was there were three days of academics and two days of [00:11:20] vocational, which was just like, so you, two days, Thursdays and [00:11:25] Fridays, you're singing, you're dancing, you're acting.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:11:27] Johnny: And basically to me, it's just playing around. Like you're [00:11:30] just having a ball and the first three days you have to focus and be like, okay, this [00:11:35] is like science and maths and all these different things that you just never ever use again. [00:11:40] I loved it. And we did this thing, um, called cabarets, which as, as [00:11:45] kids, what they would do is they would put us in like a group, a sort of select group, which again was very nice.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:11:49] Johnny: [00:11:50] Cause I guess if you were working very hard and whatever, you would sort of get into this group [00:11:55] and we would travel around the UK doing like. Sometimes outside of [00:12:00] London, doing performances at hotels. I was amazing. And we were dressed in costumes and [00:12:05] stuff. It was whole medleys and it's basically what is happening like in theater and stuff.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:12:09] Johnny: That's [00:12:10] kind of like what we're training as, as kids. So it was, and some of the people that, [00:12:15] uh, were in these cabarets are still doing it now. And we did that right through. Uh, [00:12:20] and also I think the teachers there were amazing because, [00:12:25] I don't know, I think the kids are quite mature, but also then we have to [00:12:30] learn different things.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:12:30] Johnny: So they were just always supporting us, and then helping us, guiding us through, because some [00:12:35] kids were in shows. So I did Lion King while I was at Sylvia's. So you end up missing days, and then [00:12:40] what they used to do is, they have this, this thing called CW1s, which I guess [00:12:45] is like your classwork, and they, they write down what you missed, [00:12:50] so that you can always, you get it like the next day when you come in.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:12:53] Johnny: So it was brilliant. [00:12:55] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:12:55] Oren: It was brilliant. So what advice then would you give to a young performer that is going through that [00:13:00] same kind of journey and they're in a sort of theatre [00:13:05] school and they're doing performing whilst also [00:13:10] studying? How do you actually keep up academically? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:13:12] Johnny: I mean I will say that my [00:13:15] mom was on me because I guess like academic wise coming from that background she's like [00:13:20] You have to, you know, so I think first of all, if for the person that's [00:13:25] doing it, if as much as you can do the work, I, I think in everything, if you can't, [00:13:30] like, if you're going to just put your best foot forward, that's always like, so [00:13:35] if you're on the train, do some work, then if you're, you know, you're at rehearsal, you're in the [00:13:40] dressing room or something, or anywhere that you can do the work.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:13:42] Johnny: And then I would say if there's anybody [00:13:45] around them that can help support them, that's also really helpful because up till [00:13:50] GCSEs, like my mom was like, Supporting me because like science and different things [00:13:55] like that were very, it's not that I can't do it, I got great marks at the end of my [00:14:00] time doing GCSEs, like really good ones, but my mom sat with me like reading through [00:14:05] the science books, because to me, I was like, I'm never going to use [00:14:10] this.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:10] Johnny: And so she sat down and she was like, we're going to read it together. And sometimes you [00:14:15] learn differently. So I, if I hear something and I see it, I know I take [00:14:20] it in a lot better than if I just sit in and read, you know, so I would say my [00:14:25] advice is if the, if you, if the person can also find extra [00:14:30] support, because when you're hitting the gate.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:31] Johnny: Did you take that &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:32] Claire: as support at the time, or did you feel like, Oh God, I just don't want to [00:14:35] be doing it. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:35] Johnny: No, I was, I was grateful for, cause I knew I was going into [00:14:40] the exams and I wanted to, that's the other thing. I am also a bit of like, I [00:14:45] don't want to say perfectionist cause I'm letting go of that, but like, I want to do, yeah, you know, [00:14:50] Oh my God.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:52] Johnny: To my detriment. Um, but, uh, [00:14:55] Yeah, no, I, I want to do well, you know, I, I, yeah, I don't like to not do well. [00:15:00] So I was at school going back even to that first question about how was that life? I was very goody [00:15:05] good to shoes at school, you know, um, and so even to your question, [00:15:10] it's like, my thing was, what's the work?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:15:14] Johnny: Nothing else. [00:15:15] So the parties, the exploring at that age and stuff. [00:15:20] Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Didn't come till a lot later because I think [00:15:25] subconsciously, maybe it was probably embedded in me that I was like a lot of [00:15:30] sacrifices happened so like my folks didn't come over, you know I came by myself to live with my aunt [00:15:35] I was like, I need to make this work.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:15:37] Johnny: Because [00:15:40] I know, like, I remember one time back in Trinidad, one of the teachers, I was, before we [00:15:45] had to get into class, we had these lines, so we'd be in the courtyard and we have to line up and [00:15:50] every, uh, class would go into their different, you know, rooms or whatever it is. [00:15:55] And I was in the line, but my feet were tapping around and I was moving and the teacher came up to me and she was [00:16:00] like, you know, kind of thing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:16:02] Johnny: And like, and, and then they were like, you're getting too big for [00:16:05] your boots. That was like, we've like a couple of years before I left. You're getting two big free boots [00:16:10] because I was, you know, I was seen as probably seemed fractious or [00:16:15] like, um, you know, not focused or whatever, which I was, again, I did really well in [00:16:20] the school, but because of my mom was like, but yeah, I was always, [00:16:25] yeah, wanting to do other stuff.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:16:27] Johnny: So I guess when I came here, it was just, I have to [00:16:30] really be in and make sure that this, this works, because [00:16:35] I know sometimes some of the people back at home may have been like, right. [00:16:40] What's, what are they doing? So then when I got into Lion King, I think that was like one of the sort of [00:16:45] stamps, even for my parents to be like, like he did it, you know, I remember telling my [00:16:50] mom and she was like, it's almost like, I think she always, she always believed [00:16:55] that I could do it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:16:55] Johnny: But like, I think that is like a, like a real relief for them and almost [00:17:00] like, Oh my gosh, we really made this right choice to let this child go at this age. [00:17:05] Cause this is a crazy thing. And why did we do that? Yeah. And so my mom used to come up [00:17:10] for like six months and then my mom's mom would come over because they could only stay for [00:17:15] six months at a time.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:16] Johnny: Yeah, so my grandmother would come up and like look after me [00:17:20] because my aunt was pretty busy all the time doing costumes and stuff. So I'd see her of course and she'd look after me but, [00:17:25] so it was like the three of them. I had like three moms basically. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:29] Oren: So you had them, [00:17:30] so they came on rotation basically.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:31] Oren: Because you were so &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:32] Johnny: young &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:32] Oren: that you still kept looking after them. Wow. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:34] Johnny: Yeah, so [00:17:35] they would take, like they would take me to school or like, you know, and all that kind of stuff. [00:17:40] And so I think when I got into Lion King, it was really, that was like the, yeah, sort [00:17:45] of stamp of like, okay. And even for myself, it's like, I knew I could do [00:17:50] this.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:50] Johnny: I knew it. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:50] Oren: Wow. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:51] Johnny: Where &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:52] Oren: did it go from there? So you've done Lion King. Cause I guess, cause [00:17:55] cause everything that you're speaking about really is. So passionate, but [00:18:00] also like, you know, you kind of, I think people can sort of get the impression that [00:18:05] you commit a lot. And I think that's, from working with you, that's very, very [00:18:10] true.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:18:10] Oren: And it's really interesting now seeing from an early age, just seeing like, [00:18:15] If you want something, you go for it. And I think [00:18:20] that's a really great skill, but I'm curious to know the sustainability of it. [00:18:25] Cause you did mention about perfectionism and how you're trying to let that go. How does that factor in?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:18:29] Johnny: I mean, it's a [00:18:30] lot. It's a lot. So we did Mulan together and you came in and, and while we were working on [00:18:35] auditions and stuff, I mean, it's hard. It's very hard because I think like, I think I [00:18:40] also have this thing in my mind where, uh, it's possible. If, [00:18:45] if they can do it, I can do it because they're not an alien.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:18:48] Johnny: They're human. So, which [00:18:50] sometimes it's not really the case, you know, Jeremy, like I said, yeah, [00:18:55] yes, they, uh, they've been given a gift and that is this, and I should, and this is what [00:19:00] I have, you know, this is what, but so. I will work till like, you [00:19:05] know, so during Mulan, you know, that was, it was tough for me because I think vocally [00:19:10] the requirements were, were tough and I, and my voice could do it for sure.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:19:14] Johnny: It was [00:19:15] doing it and reworked and stuff, but like the times that it wouldn't do it would [00:19:20] make me go like, Oh my God, you know? And so it's, I think the [00:19:25] perfectionism thing comes in there because if it doesn't happen, I am like, what's wrong? [00:19:30] Why can't you do it? And I, I think, so there's, it's [00:19:35] sometimes that is hard to sustain being like on it [00:19:40] all the time.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:19:41] Johnny: But I do listen to, I think, you know, there's like a lot of [00:19:45] motivational talks and stuff and, um, Les [00:19:50] Brown, uh, he always says this that I'll like, you know, uh, you shoot for the moon [00:19:55] and if you miss you'll out among the stars. So that is like something that, you know, [00:20:00] so I, if I'm, if I'm going in, I think you have to commit.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:20:04] Johnny: My [00:20:05] mom always says this as well. She was just like, you know, if you're going to do anything, just put your best foot forward. So I think [00:20:10] that's sort of been, uh, yeah, embedded in me. [00:20:15] Um, and yeah, you run into problems with it, but more [00:20:20] than often it serves you better. Then the not, you know what I mean?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:20:24] Johnny: Because I [00:20:25] think people also love effort and work ethic and [00:20:30] a person that like Tries and stuff like that. I know, like, if I see that [00:20:35] even cause I teach and stuff and you know, it's not like they don't need to be perfect. And that's, that's [00:20:40] the thing that I have to take on board. It's never that they're perfect.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:20:42] Johnny: What, what you're attracted to is the fight, [00:20:45] the bite, the passion, the, you know, that thing that makes [00:20:50] you feel something. So I don't know. I mean, I, I try to manage it. I try to [00:20:55] have a lot more self love or practice that. You know, it's art, and [00:21:00] at that, at some point, it's, it becomes, it can be messy when [00:21:05] you're trying to get your, your goal.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:08] Johnny: Or even, not even in art, [00:21:10] everything else. Athletes are the same. If you have to really run towards [00:21:15] whatever you, you're going for. I &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:16] Claire: mean, I was saying to Warren earlier, I think you, you have one of the [00:21:20] strongest work and practice ethics of anyone I've worked with. [00:21:25] It's too much. Sometimes it's overdone. Oh my God.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:29] Johnny: I'm on [00:21:30] holiday and I'm like, Like blowing straws, like blowing bubbles, I literally, [00:21:35] that's me, yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:36] Claire: But also, you seem to have, it's [00:21:40] interesting, you're saying about, you know, you always assume that it is possible because [00:21:45] you have such an open mentality to learning and to going down what I [00:21:50] call the rabbit hole and finding out what's at the other end of it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:52] Claire: Like you're very open to that. There's no, [00:21:55] there doesn't seem to be fear. [00:22:00] Right. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:01] Johnny: Yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:02] Claire: There's, there's never fear of, well, but what if I lose [00:22:05] this tone in the, in the pursuit of another, you're the, the [00:22:10] evolution of your vocal qualities has been beautifully [00:22:15] organic because you're never, you're never kind of going, no, no, no, I just want to stay here.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:19] Claire: Just let [00:22:20] me stay here. Right. Right. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:21] Johnny: Open to. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:22] Claire: And you're also incredibly self motivated, which [00:22:25] I wonder if you think, does that come from coming here alone? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:28] Johnny: Yeah. [00:22:30] I do wonder about that sometimes as well. It's interesting you raise that because like, [00:22:35] because now it's been, I guess, 20 years and I still feel like a, [00:22:40] a push, but like, I just, now it's like, I feel like I'm more [00:22:45] choosy to what I do, but it, there's definitely still this, like, [00:22:50] I don't know what it is, like an energy.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:51] Johnny: It's like a bite. Like I, I want to do this. I want [00:22:55] to, Achieve this. I still, which, yeah, from young, I guess. I don't know if it's that [00:23:00] move that made me do that or like now it's just habit. So [00:23:05] because my habit is to, to push, push, push, push, push until I achieve the thing that [00:23:10] I want. Um, I don't know. I don't know exactly [00:23:15] what, what is keeping me going like that, but I'm grateful that it's there.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:23:19] Johnny: Um, [00:23:20] you know, and that I still am enjoying it. But I think sometimes [00:23:25] the part, I need to go back to even what you're saying, Orin, it's like, I need to be careful because then the [00:23:30] joy comes out if you're fighting all the [00:23:35] time. You know what I mean? I think that's kind of, I think sometimes what I experienced.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:23:39] Johnny: [00:23:40] on Mulan was that like as amazing and [00:23:45] like there were some highs for me in the show that I loved and like I looking back on it like I [00:23:50] adore it I adore that we got to do these award shows I adore the things I sang that my [00:23:55] voice was doing those things and then there's also this other part which I guess [00:24:00] people don't really know because you won't know when the curtains come up we're all glamored up and [00:24:05] but you there's this other side that is is hard and very [00:24:10] lonely it's very Um, and yeah, [00:24:15] and, and at that point it's, I'm, I'm intentionally in my habit [00:24:20] going to these motivational talks to help me to continue [00:24:25] because I think it may appear that I'm like, I'm always on the thing, but actually sometimes I think [00:24:30] it comes out of fair.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:24:32] Johnny: My drive. to almost like, [00:24:35] not fair to fail, but like fair to not be [00:24:40] excellent at like what I think I should be. So it should be excellent in the show. So [00:24:45] I'm going to, I have to come and see you and have to have all these lessons. I have to make sure that it's, or if it's the [00:24:50] audition, I need to be able to present the right thing and it has to be brilliant.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:24:53] Johnny: So I have to do all these lessons to make sure that [00:24:55] how it doesn't mishap when I'm, Do you see what I mean? So like, sometimes it's not [00:25:00] always, I don't think for me out of a positive thing that I'm [00:25:05] going to be brave and I'm just working hard and I love it. It's sometimes it's like, I'm afraid [00:25:10] because I know when the, the five, six, seven, eight comes and the lights are there and the [00:25:15] action and the audience, and you have to open your mouth and it has to be there and that pressure.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:25:19] Johnny: I'm like, [00:25:20] so I need to be as best prepared for it. So some, I [00:25:25] think before, when I was a kid, I think it was just happening. It wasn't really, I was just [00:25:30] running. And now sometimes it's like, are you sure you're ready? [00:25:35] How, how can you make yourself as ready as possible? Um, so that you can at [00:25:40] least try and feel as comfortable as possible versus before.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:25:43] Johnny: What would happen &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:25:44] Oren: if it went wrong? [00:25:45] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:25:45] Johnny: I was just gonna say that. Yeah, nothing. That's the thing. Well, actually, [00:25:50] uh, I think internally it sometimes affects me. Cause I [00:25:55] remember I was in rehearsal and one time things didn't go right. And, you know, and I, and I [00:26:00] think. That stuff. You do hold on to it. But [00:26:05] then I know it pushed me to get.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:26:07] Johnny: The rest of the stuff. So because of that experience, [00:26:10] a bunch of other amazing things happened. And so that's, yeah, it's a good question. Cause I [00:26:15] feel like I'm letting, I'm definitely feeling a different place. Now it's like maybe a [00:26:20] year ago. I don't know if that's just because I'm not having to do the thing every day.[00:26:25] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:26:26] Johnny: If it happens, if you went wrong, you go wrong. [00:26:30] That's the thing. And that's what I'm, I'm trying to learn and to enjoy. Like, even if I'm [00:26:35] taking like a dance class and stuff, That's the other thing. So [00:26:40] in dance, which I think is different from the acting discipline and the singing [00:26:45] discipline, there is a strive for perfection.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:26:49] Johnny: [00:26:50] Ballet, um, it, you know, when you're taking those things, it is, it's so [00:26:55] strict. And I was also in a hip hop company. Uh, when I was at Sylvia's. So year 10 and [00:27:00] 11, I was in this hip hop company and they were all older than me. So I was like the youngest [00:27:05] one. Um, but they let me in because I used to take their classes outside of, [00:27:10] uh, their company and, uh, I put my hat, [00:27:15] like, down to them.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:27:15] Johnny: They literally, Cisco Gomez and Kimberly Taylor, like, fantastic. They [00:27:20] were, trained, trained me. And I'm so grateful to them because [00:27:25] it was hard. It was hard, like, you know, it's, it, you're, you're, you're having to be [00:27:30] so, um, like a dart, you know, darts, like, and it's the [00:27:35] bullseye. That's what I think in the entertainment industry or like as performers.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:27:39] Johnny: That's [00:27:40] what I feel is sometimes different to, like, athletes. They're, um, they're amazing and, [00:27:45] and, like, for instance, like a footballer. Yes, they want to score the goal, but if they don't score the goal, [00:27:50] that's okay. That's part of the game. Boom, boom, boom. If, if we put the big note at [00:27:55] the end of the defying gravity as the goal, it has to be scored every night.[00:28:00] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:28:00] Johnny: Every. Single. Night. It has to be, because the second that you don't score it, [00:28:05] what's wrong with them? They're busted, or, you know what I mean, like, And how, and [00:28:10] so you have to really hit it. So I think that part of [00:28:15] things, I think really that, that discipline and probably because I trained in it a lot [00:28:20] and even now teaching it, there is that, that sort of discipline, but then [00:28:25] it flips sometimes to the other side of you want it to be perfect.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:28:28] Johnny: And then when you get to singing and [00:28:30] stuff, I feel like you can make. sounds that are not [00:28:35] perfect, but it is authentic and it is beautiful and it's the right thing for [00:28:40] that moment and that's okay and it's brilliant. And then when you get to acting, I remember I was, I was doing [00:28:45] a lot of acting classes in the pandemic and um, it's like [00:28:50] the reverse.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:28:51] Johnny: They don't want anything perfect. They don't want anything [00:28:55] showed. You can't place this here. You don't think about that. What you're thinking about is this thing. And what we [00:29:00] want is. I just want to see the mess. And in dance [00:29:05] sometimes you, you clean up all of it. You just, and you look in the mirror, you know, we work with mirrors a [00:29:10] lot.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:10] Johnny: So you're always striving for the matching arm of this person, this person, the person, okay, [00:29:15] our arms are there, and then our arms are there. Perfect. And then the head and the chin is to that detail. [00:29:20] Do you know what I mean? So, and then you put that into, I think sometimes you just, you [00:29:25] walk with that. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:25] Claire: So as a teacher, do you, do you think it's possible to teach dance [00:29:30] And maintain a healthy perspective on that question.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:34] Claire: [00:29:35] perfection. I'm interested because you're now going at it from the other end. You're, yeah, you're now at the front of the class. [00:29:40] Do you feel that you need to, to make a change in how it's taught? Do you feel that [00:29:45] it's possible to make a change? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:47] Johnny: You know, even like my friend Cisco, the one who taught me, you know, like even, [00:29:50] I think as we go along, like even his methods of teaching have changed.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:54] Johnny: He's still [00:29:55] strict. But then there's also a lot of like love and I think that I think, [00:30:00] you know, some people probably manage this better than others, but I think you [00:30:05] have to have a certain amount of hold on them or on on students or whoever is [00:30:10] taking the class because, um, the good thing about the fair [00:30:15] based sort of way.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:30:15] Johnny: Yeah. Or the fire training, uh, where there is [00:30:20] like that heat breeds results because you do something, the [00:30:25] students will do something that they didn't think that they could do. So you could get that results out of them. And then I think on [00:30:30] the other side, you just have to have like, as soon as the class finishes, No, that [00:30:35] it's, they can be comfortable around you or loving with you or that kind of [00:30:40] stuff, you know, so that, so that there's a balance in terms of if I think I could change, not [00:30:45] change it, not particularly because I think it's so widespread.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:30:49] Johnny: And I [00:30:50] also feel that like a lot of the people that I look up to, [00:30:55] uh, their training may have been very, very tough, like super tough. [00:31:00] And then, but when I see them on the stage, I'm like, I want to be like them. So I [00:31:05] can't say, you know, but I can only do, I guess what I'll do, which is I try and have like a [00:31:10] balance of like, you know, you do have to push them because, um, if they [00:31:15] don't feel the toughness of it, the other part is when they get into the industry.[00:31:20] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:20] Johnny: Um, then they're not aware of what circumstances they can [00:31:25] come into. And so, and then I think it also just helps them to [00:31:30] be a bit more on the ball, a little bit on their toes, which I feel like we all are [00:31:35] when, when we get into a room, because we've seen how different things happen. And then you would [00:31:40] just, you try and support them as much as you can, or at least let them know that the [00:31:45] toughness is coming from a place where we want them to be.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:47] Johnny: You know, [00:31:50] as, as long as I think those sort of lines are made clear or sort of [00:31:55] those are givens, then, then I think it's, it's good. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:58] Claire: It's really interesting because I think [00:32:00] that's quite different from my experience of [00:32:05] coaching. Yeah. And I'm sitting and thinking, [00:32:10] could I coach with, with that? I think we are always looking for excellence.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:14] Claire: We're [00:32:15] always. Searching for the most and the [00:32:20] best that your voice can produce. I genuinely think it's counterproductive in the [00:32:25] singing realm. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:25] Johnny: I think so too, yeah. And it's &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:27] Claire: interesting to me that that, that the two [00:32:30] disciplines should be so different because we're still talking about the body, we're still talking about muscles.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:34] Claire: Yeah, you're &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:34] Oren: [00:32:35] right, you're right. But I think we're fundamentally using the body differently. I think with, with [00:32:40] dance, there is a greater sense of precision and [00:32:45] control over the body. Whereas with singing, [00:32:50] if we had that level of control and tension [00:32:55] I think we lose a lot of the, a lot of what we want from the voice because we're [00:33:00] introducing more constraints.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:02] Oren: I think singing is more freeing. I [00:33:05] mean, obviously dance is very freeing, but in a very different way. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:09] Claire: [00:33:10] What's your experience of it within your physical experience? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:14] Johnny: [00:33:15] Singing, and I, for me, and I think for a lot of people, would probably come from the [00:33:20] downside. I've heard this as well. I would say it sometimes is a very vulnerable place.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:23] Johnny: [00:33:25] Is powerful, but it's also, on the flip side, [00:33:30] quite scary to sometimes open up. But I do, I have experienced that moment where, [00:33:35] I think I was doing In the Heights, I really loved it. Dark Show and I was covering a part [00:33:40] and I remember going on stage and this, this part had to sing more and there was like this rap section [00:33:45] and you stand in this chair and you like, you sort of like go out to the audience like [00:33:50] with your hand and you're like rapping this, this thing and the rap is like amazing and I'm like, I'm not a rapper.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:54] Johnny: [00:33:55] So I was like, I need to get this together because These people looking at me [00:34:00] thinking that I can wrap these words. And I remember feeling, it was almost like say my part [00:34:05] had these like little pretty wings. Like this was like the part that I would do and that's, I [00:34:10] had a role, but I covered another role.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:34:11] Johnny: And when I got into that role, it was like the, the [00:34:15] wings just went out and it was amazing. And. Uh, I've definitely [00:34:20] like through Mulan I felt lots of times where it it just felt like free It's almost like you're like [00:34:25] soaring you just the thing opens up and you're there and it's like this amazing experience [00:34:30] but then I think with dance it's different where I just it's almost like [00:34:35] for me the music is there and you're just You're just in and I remember I spoke [00:34:40] to one of my friends recently and he said what do you think about when you're?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:34:43] Johnny: Dancing and I was like this sounds so [00:34:45] corny, but it's like what billy elliott said. It's like You You, you know, he's like, I suppose it's like [00:34:50] forgetting losing who you are, right? The whole lyrics and he's like electricity. You literally just you're just in I don't I [00:34:55] this to some point you don't really think at some point you might be like, Oh gosh, I hope I hit the step [00:35:00] correctly.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:35:00] Johnny: Boom. Okay. That's great. Now it's done. And I'm, I'm going, but I was going to say that I [00:35:05] think it's different for teaching, singing and dance. I [00:35:10] mean, mostly you would be working one on one, right? So we usually work, I'm [00:35:15] working with like a group of like 20 or 25, sometimes a lot [00:35:20] bigger. And then the idea is to get that whole mass.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:35:24] Johnny: It's [00:35:25] moving in the same direction in the same way with all the dynamics and I want [00:35:30] to see it correctly. You know what I mean? So you're just like, and then there's, you know, usually [00:35:35] some classes are brilliant and you have people that have the mindset of like, we're [00:35:40] here to work. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:35:41] Johnny: And I see it even like, you know, cause I teach at a college. [00:35:45] So you have different energies for every group. It's so interesting. You're teaching the same [00:35:50] thing to each group. And one time, one group can come in and the class is like on fire. [00:35:55] It's like fireworks and everything. And it's just like soaring.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:35:58] Johnny: You're just like, Oh, this is a breeze. [00:36:00] You get to the next class and you're like, why does it look like this? Like what's happening? Like, [00:36:05] do you know what I mean? It was like. what's going on and you and you do and you see that and you're like it's a bit [00:36:10] different because i feel like if you were like if both because [00:36:15] both of you all have worked with me if you were strict with me like while i was singing and stuff i'll be like this is [00:36:20] too much it's too much because you have to it's almost like it's the reverse of that you're always having [00:36:25] to let go of everything for it to like open up, [00:36:30] you know, so it's you and you, and I do feel like dances can be [00:36:35] very emotional as well.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:36:37] Johnny: But I think with singing, there is something that is [00:36:40] like tied to like your voice, like the, just the, the thing of the [00:36:45] voice, like that, like emotion. So if you're, [00:36:50] I don't know. Like if you're, you have to sing this high note, you know, when you guys say cry or whatever, [00:36:55] like that stuff, like you can't be tense.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:36:57] Johnny: So I think it's very different. Like the [00:37:00] mind work is so helpful in the singing realm, but I think with [00:37:05] dance, you know, I just, and I think it's, it's how it's passed down from, you know, Generations, you know, [00:37:10] like, so my mentor Cisco, you know, the training that he had and who he worked [00:37:15] under, you know, they're tough.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:37:16] Johnny: Um, and, and I look at that person and I think that they're [00:37:20] amazing and I know he trained under Brian Friedman and Brian is amazing. [00:37:25] You know, fantastic. And, but the people that trained Brian, again, everybody is like, [00:37:30] you know, and as you go up the ladder, they're probably stricter as you, you know what I mean?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:37:34] Johnny: [00:37:35] Like, because they're, now everybody is, um, in the modern day, it's like, [00:37:40] you know, you can't say this, and we have the pronouns, and we have the [00:37:45] this, and this, and all these different things that are happening now where people are taking so much more care. [00:37:50] You have to be so much more careful. But back in the day, get it together.[00:37:55] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:37:55] Claire: Yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:37:55] Johnny: Your cup. You know, I remember seeing one time we were in company [00:38:00] rehearsals and we were supposed to remember these routines, and one girl didn't and [00:38:05] he was just like, you need to go, you need to leave . Wow. We [00:38:10] saw her pick up a bag and she left the rehearsal, and we were just like, but [00:38:15] what does that do?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:38:16] Johnny: One to the person? Yeah. In some way. So there's the, there's the [00:38:20] negative side, right? Mm-Hmm. where, how does that affect the person? But [00:38:25] the teaching part of it is, is that. Now, they have a choice. Will [00:38:30] they do that to themselves again? Because everybody else knew the routines, right? So, oh, and [00:38:35] then for the rest of us, it's like, make sure you guys, you're on [00:38:40] it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:38:40] Johnny: So this, so now when I'm teaching, I have that sort of instilled, [00:38:45] not that I do that, but I, I tell them, this is how we work. We're going to do this routine [00:38:50] this week, next routine that week, sorry, the same routine next week. And then I want to see it [00:38:55] done by the third week. We have like three weeks, you know, and so by that expectation, [00:39:00] but that's coming from the generation before.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:02] Johnny: You know what I mean? So it's like, you just, you kind of pass [00:39:05] down what you get taught, whether sometimes it's the right way or the wrong [00:39:10] way. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:10] Claire: I think it is possible to chase excellence. [00:39:15] Yeah. And build in some understanding. So the first thing I'm thinking in that [00:39:20] situation is, is we need to have a conversation with that person and say, why has this not been learned?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:24] Johnny: [00:39:25] Right. Yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:26] Claire: Is there something we can do to support you with it? Because maybe you learn in a different [00:39:30] way or whatever. Now, if that is fruitless. Then of course we have to say, I'm sorry, [00:39:35] this isn't working, you know, but I think that's, that's the difference, isn't it? Is actually making the [00:39:40] connection and finding out.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:41] Claire: Yeah. Why it's going wrong. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:43] Johnny: Why it's happening, yeah. Which maybe &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:44] Claire: didn't [00:39:45] happen before, but it's definitely happening a lot more. And it's why I encourage all the [00:39:50] performers I work with to go and have a conversation if they're struggling. Yeah. Like, go and talk [00:39:55] to your company manager. Go. It's super scary to do, but actually [00:40:00] now it's becoming something that companies really value because then they can help and [00:40:05] then they end up with a better company and a better performance.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:08] Johnny: So that's the thing. I think we're all [00:40:10] heading in a. better direction than previously because, um, [00:40:15] it's, yeah, I think in the dance world, some things sometimes have been said that are like, [00:40:20] you know, it's just, yeah, it's not, yeah. I mean, even in theater and [00:40:25] directing and all that stuff, it's like, &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:27] Claire: we didn't actually do a, you know, what happens [00:40:30] after Sylvia Young.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:31] Claire: Yes. Yes. Let's go back to edit all that out. [00:40:35] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:35] Johnny: Start again. Yes. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:37] Claire: Just to fill in the blanks. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:38] Johnny: So, um, [00:40:40] Sylvia Young happens. I finished Sylvia Young, loved it. It was brilliant. [00:40:45] Then I got into a band. It was two boys, two girls, um, [00:40:50] out of Sylvia Young. So they had like their own band. Um, and that, [00:40:55] uh, it, I think I was in it for a year and at the time I had [00:41:00] gotten into Lanes.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:41:01] Johnny: But I decided not to go because I wanted to do the band. [00:41:05] And then I was like, Oh, I don't think this is like really working for [00:41:10] me. I feel like I want to get like an education or something. So I went and did two years of graphic design [00:41:15] instead of continuing on in performing. While I [00:41:20] was doing that, I was.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:41:22] Johnny: I was on tour with an [00:41:25] artist because the course was only three days a week, but it was a full time course. Um, [00:41:30] so we did three days and then I would go [00:41:35] to I remember one time we were in Brazil, which was amazing. And then I was [00:41:40] at like these different festivals in town, like V Fest and all these different things we were performing.[00:41:45] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:41:45] Johnny: Um, and then, uh, I got a message [00:41:50] from, I think her name was Jamie. [00:41:55] Um, she, basically she was working for this agency. Um, and. She [00:42:00] said, what did you think about going into theater again? And I had sort of taken a step away from theater because I [00:42:05] was doing like a lot of commercial work. And I was kind of like, I started [00:42:10] assisting, sometimes choreographing even.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:42:12] Johnny: Um, and I was assisting Cisco [00:42:15] and, you know, helping out there. So then I, I went to audition for [00:42:20] In the Heights. And I remember thinking, I was like, Oh, you know, I don't know [00:42:25] about this, but I loved it. It was brilliant. And then I got into In the Heights. And then from then [00:42:30] on. I was like, this is it. Like, I love [00:42:35] this.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:42:35] Johnny: Because you get to dance, you get to sing, you get to act, you're expressing through all the channels, um, which [00:42:40] was amazing. And then, After that, it started to roll from there [00:42:45] because, um, then I got to do some films. I, you know, [00:42:50] Heights was Lynn. So that's kind of tied over into Hamilton. And then, [00:42:55] um, and then, yeah, I kind of, I feel like I've done a few films that Lynn [00:43:00] has been attached to.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:01] Johnny: Not by like, uh, on purpose, but it [00:43:05] just kind of worked out that way. So I was in Poppins while I was there with, uh, when [00:43:10] he was there and then we were going into Hamilton. So he knew that I was going into Hamilton [00:43:15] before I'd even said anything to him. Uh, which was interesting because he was on set and he [00:43:20] was like, yeah, I know.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:20] Johnny: And I was like, how'd you know, how'd you know that I'm doing this? It [00:43:25] was coming up like, you know, and yeah, he was like, yeah, he'd seen, you know, there were a couple of us. So, and, [00:43:30] and so I've sort of been in the theater space quite a bit and then [00:43:35] I would take some time out and then I might end up doing a bit of commercial stuff and, and then, [00:43:40] yeah.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:40] Johnny: And then I got into Mulan after the pandemic. Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge. Not [00:43:45] Mulan. Like, you know, the Disney film, uh, Moulin Rouge. [00:43:50] And yeah. And then here &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:51] Claire: we are. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:52] Johnny: Really, I think that's kind of something &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:54] Claire: strikes [00:43:55] me here all the way through this conversation. You speak with great passion [00:44:00] about dancing and singing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:02] Claire: Yeah. Not at any point [00:44:05] have you mentioned audience. Uhhuh. . &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:09] Johnny: Okay. [00:44:10] And I &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:10] Claire: think that's quite interesting. Like a lot of people I speak to were like, you know, I did my [00:44:15] first Amram thing. Okay. And I, I just loved being in front of that audience. Or [00:44:20] audience. Mm-Hmm. , you know.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:24] Claire: It [00:44:25] just makes me wonder what the driving I mean, [00:44:30] clearly this was in you right, like, from the start. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:32] Johnny: Yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:33] Claire: Is it the doing it [00:44:35] more than the performing it? I &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:36] Johnny: think so. Yeah. I mean, there, I [00:44:40] think there's definitely something about like, um, for me being [00:44:45] on stage, which is like, I know that something comes [00:44:50] alive, like as a, like a, a switch or something, you know, like if I have to be on, [00:44:55] it's like.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:56] Johnny: And we're there. Boom. And I do love the audience and stuff, [00:45:00] but yeah, I think, and maybe that's why I train so much and I love that side of [00:45:05] stuff because to me, it's like, I think the audience and stuff, yes, [00:45:10] brilliant, but the art for me comes first. The art and the craft [00:45:15] of it. So I, I really enjoy, I, um, creating things as well [00:45:20] and doing like my own videos and working in studios and things [00:45:25] like that.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:45:25] Johnny: So of course I love performing, but also I think I can be [00:45:30] fulfilled if I collaborate with somebody. One person in a room [00:45:35] or if we have a great singing lesson and we, you know, we're doing the, or [00:45:40] we achieve something. Yeah. And I think that the audience, they, they always, they come on board like [00:45:45] last. Kind of, kind of thing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:45:47] Johnny: I feel it's not like, that I [00:45:50] really think about that. I think if I, if I can do the best that I can do, then, [00:45:55] then that's gonna be great. And I think the other thing is, I always feel like, you [00:46:00] know, you just want to be able to move whoever it is. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:04] Claire: Does it change [00:46:05] anything for you? If the audience is saying that the brain doesn't necessarily know the [00:46:10] difference between performance and rehearsal, if you teach it performance.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:13] Claire: So yeah, &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:14] Johnny: you &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:14] Claire: [00:46:15] feel &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:16] Johnny: that there's &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:17] Claire: something changes. Does, does the audience [00:46:20] change what you do? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:22] Johnny: I think it, I mean, it gives you that extra [00:46:25] adrenaline for sure. I think, and especially even with things when it comes to like [00:46:30] high singing and stuff, sometimes actually having being in that space [00:46:35] where you're like, it's.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:36] Johnny: fight or flight, you know, because [00:46:40] everybody watching, you know, and then suddenly the body just, it's so it's intelligent. It's on its own. It has, [00:46:45] so it will do the extra thing. We were doing the Olivier's and I remember like we're, [00:46:50] we're behind the, the things are about to open like this and it's four of us [00:46:55] and we're like, so I'm in this pose like this and I'm like, oh my Jesus.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:59] Johnny: Like, I just [00:47:00] hope that I hit this note because this is going on camera. This is like all of the, the [00:47:05] best performers are in this room. I was like, it's, you know, it's fine if in a show, you know, it's not exactly, but [00:47:10] this one, this is it. And we had done that like maybe four times [00:47:15] for the day because we had, we got there early in the morning.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:47:17] Johnny: And we had to do like a tech run, a dress run, [00:47:20] and then like another dress run. So I'm now like, oh my gosh, and this is the [00:47:25] last day of the week. So we've done, we've done eight shows. And now we're doing, [00:47:30] um, this performance. And then, you know, you have another eight shows to go the [00:47:35] next week. There's no break.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:47:35] Johnny: So you're just like, ugh. And I remember the things open and the, [00:47:40] the audience were just like, they just went wild. Like, and we were sort of like in silhouettes or [00:47:45] whatever. And instantly, like all the, the nervous, like it just left. [00:47:50] I don't know how. I don't know how it left and I remember coming down and then it was just like it was just free [00:47:55] Like I was like, let's go.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:47:56] Johnny: That's probably one of the most confident times I felt [00:48:00] probably Or like, it was, I remember we all came off and we were like, that was so much fun. Like all [00:48:05] the three girls, we were like, it's amazing. Um, so yeah, I think that the [00:48:10] audience can definitely lift and [00:48:15] inspire and, you know, it makes it worth it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:17] Johnny: There's a, &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:17] Claire: talking, going back &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:18] Johnny: to &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:18] Claire: high notes and things. I [00:48:20] think sometimes in the rehearsal room, in the practice room, actually, [00:48:25] sometimes the stakes are not high enough &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:27] Johnny: to warrant &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:28] Claire: that sound. [00:48:30] And so it feels really alien and a bit like, really, am I going to make that? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:34] Johnny: And [00:48:35] space as well. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:35] Claire: And space, right? And then suddenly, actually, you're on stage [00:48:40] and there's an audience out there and it has to be right.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:42] Claire: And suddenly the stakes are in exactly the right place. And as you say, the [00:48:45] body is so intelligent. It's like, oh, okay, now this makes sense. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:48] Johnny: Yeah. It's [00:48:50] really weird. Because yeah, for instance, like Chandelier, for instance, you know, like in the show, [00:48:55] it's sometimes scary. Like that's actually probably easier in the, in the show.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:59] Johnny: In [00:49:00] actuality, then it is like in a studio. We're like in a room, [00:49:05] sing the note. You're like, this is like, it's just the top of the, how'd you even like get onto the, [00:49:10] you know, like, whereas you're in the show and you're moving around or whatever, and you know, like the, there's, you're playing it that way. [00:49:15] So like the, the audience is so big, it's, it's up and everything.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:49:18] Johnny: And you're, you know, so [00:49:20] already your body sorts of just, um, does that. So, yeah, I do think, [00:49:25] I think that it definitely changes. Yeah. Um, how [00:49:30] things, how things go. But. I guess the strive is to be able to do [00:49:35] it on demand, in a small studio, on a mic, or whatever it is, you know. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:49:39] Oren: So [00:49:40] you've come sort of full circle a little bit, because you, you started off performing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:49:43] Oren: Yeah. Then [00:49:45] went into teaching, a little bit of choreography in between, um, and now [00:49:50] into producing your own, uh, videos. Yeah. Short form that is [00:49:55] encompasses all of those skills. Yeah. Tell me about &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:49:57] Johnny: Jump. Jump, uh, is a [00:50:00] video that I just did and it's a dance based video, um, [00:50:05] which I think is going to be part one of possibly quite a [00:50:10] few different parts, which I kind of want to join up together.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:50:12] Johnny: Hopefully, maybe make a short film, [00:50:15] maybe a pilot, if somebody wants to invest or something, you know, to just Anybody? Yes, [00:50:20] um, because no, I, I think What I, [00:50:25] I love, I love being in the films and, and different things like that. And I felt [00:50:30] like I wanted to kind of be at the helm of it and see, see what that [00:50:35] was like.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:50:35] Johnny: And I, what was fun about it is I was, I was directing and then choreographing it. [00:50:40] And um, and then being in it. And I love sort [00:50:45] of getting to sort of hop around. Even on the day and we had a lot of fun. We laughed a [00:50:50] lot And that's the part where I think which kind of goes back even to [00:50:55] what we were saying before.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:50:55] Johnny: It's like the If, if you [00:51:00] can have fun on the thing that really makes it all worthwhile. So [00:51:05] I was talking to some of the dancers and they said, you know, thank you so much for like having us like it, we had such [00:51:10] a great time and experience and stuff like that. So yeah. And then, and then to see the [00:51:15] response, you kind of go shoot, like, that's it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:51:17] Johnny: Like, that's what I want. That's, that's how I want to feel at [00:51:20] least, you know, that you can, You can make your own stuff that [00:51:25] is, I think, true to me. It's true that I understand what's happening [00:51:30] and then it has like an impact. It's impactful for me, but it's also [00:51:35] impactful for people that are. Um, and just to say like what happens in [00:51:40] Jump is basically, uh, there's an audition happening and, uh, [00:51:45] I'm playing this character who we don't know their name yet.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:51:48] Johnny: Um, but basically [00:51:50] he, the, the girls dance and then the, the boys dance and then, He [00:51:55] actually, he gets cut, um, and then the video kind of ends there saying like to be continued. [00:52:00] But the thing is the character is actually doing an amazing job. They're, you know, able to hit [00:52:05] all the steps and they're, they're correct with everything and whatever, and they're actually central.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:52:09] Johnny: Um, [00:52:10] and I remember some people when they saw it, they were like, Why did, why did you get, [00:52:15] like, that's, that's not true. Like, that's not it. And I'm like, but that's actually what, that's the [00:52:20] industry. It's like, it actually doesn't, you know, so I think in some ways, like, I guess it wasn't [00:52:25] like maybe a comment on.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:52:26] Johnny: Sometimes how things go. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:52:28] Claire: I was with some people [00:52:30] on Saturday morning just after you'd released it. Oh yeah. Who had seen it and a couple were [00:52:35] like, actually that really brought tears to my eye because that's real. That's real. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:52:39] Johnny: [00:52:40] Yeah. It's so hard and then you, you know, so for that character, you know, and in real, in the [00:52:45] reality is like you go away and you're like, what happened?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:52:49] Johnny: Like, I [00:52:50] don't understand. There was no feedback. It's just thank you. And that's, you know, That's what [00:52:55] happens. Y'all know. That's what happens. Because, yeah. And you just, you [00:53:00] wonder, yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:00] Oren: Sorry, don't want to cut you off. So is that the idea behind this sort of series then, is to comment [00:53:05] on things that happen in this industry?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:06] Johnny: Uh, maybe. I think in this first part [00:53:10] there is probably a comment on it. Please, nobody be upset with me for that. But, you know, I just think [00:53:15] there is &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:15] Claire: that. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:16] Johnny: Yeah, it's a real thing. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:17] Claire: It's a reflection of, not necessarily a comment [00:53:20] on, but, you know. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:21] Johnny: And then I think, but I, I, I just think [00:53:25] it's, what I hope to sort of do is to be like, just continue on, just keep pushing, [00:53:30] because if you do, I think the right thing will come for you.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:34] Johnny: That's [00:53:35] kind of, I think what I would like to say in the next coming things. [00:53:40] But I think in isolation, it probably, it is kind of like a comment to [00:53:45] say, this is what happens, and it's very hard, but it's actually nothing to do [00:53:50] with sometimes the, what you're doing. You know, it's to do [00:53:55] with, you know, and I've sat, I've, I've been on panels with like [00:54:00] different casting teams or whatever, and I've sat in, listened to different things and, you know, [00:54:05] it's not always the person who is, uh, the most talented or [00:54:10] right, you know, it's just like, who's right for the puzzle, you know, that [00:54:15] they're, that they, and that's, that's right.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:16] Johnny: That's going to serve the thing. And I think it's [00:54:20] hard. It's very hard for performers, you know, because you you're striving, you're striving [00:54:25] and then like. I guess they, I think there's space for everybody, but it's not [00:54:30] always that there's space in that particular thing, or that particular thing, and then, you know.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:34] Johnny: Or &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:34] Claire: in this [00:54:35] moment. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:35] Johnny: In this moment, yeah. Yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:36] Oren: So it's, it's tricky. You &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:38] Johnny: hang &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:38] Oren: in there. In this book [00:54:40] is a question written by the previous guest, and I don't have to [00:54:45] answer it. You have to answer the question. We've also not seen the question. Okay, this is actually a [00:54:50] fantastic question for you, in particular.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:52] Johnny: Oh god. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:54] Oren: It's really good. [00:54:55] If you could have made one change of direction in your career [00:55:00] trajectory, what would it have been and when would you, and when would you have made it? [00:55:05] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:05] Claire: Wow. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:06] Johnny: If I went to college. [00:55:10] You know, if that would have helped me get in the rooms for things better. Like, [00:55:15] cause I, for a while, until I did Hamilton, it was like, Hamilton became like the ace [00:55:20] card for me where they would be like, Oh, he's been in Hamilton.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:23] Johnny: Great. We'll get him in the room now. [00:55:25] But before that, it was like, who are you? What have you done? At this point I was, I was [00:55:30] doing, you know, really good stuff, but it just for casting directors and stuff, they [00:55:35] were like, He can't be seen for a role or he can't be seen for anything. So sometimes I think about [00:55:40] that, but the reality of it is, it's like, you know, I think I'm grateful for [00:55:45] where I'm at presently and the things that I've done.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:48] Johnny: And [00:55:50] it had to happen that way. That's how I feel. So I [00:55:55] actually, I wouldn't change anything. And actually, when I was younger, I [00:56:00] wanted to go to Royal Ballet because I trained on a Saturday [00:56:05] there while I was at Sylvia's. And I did, uh, yeah, so I was, I was getting like [00:56:10] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:56:10] Claire: hip hop, I'm very, yeah, I know. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:56:12] Johnny: Right. Just doing this.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:56:14] Johnny: I [00:56:15] made it guys. This me, I'm always doing the most doing, uh, it's doing the hip hop company with [00:56:20] the training methodology at Sylvia's. And then you get Royal on a Saturday. And [00:56:25] I remember I said to my mom, we actually argued about it. Cause I was like, you know, I think [00:56:30] I want to go and do that. I don't have the turnout to be a ballet dancer.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:56:33] Johnny: I don't have the, I'm too [00:56:35] short. I'm too, I'm too this, I'm too that. Like, I remember my teacher, he loved me, the ballet teacher at Royal. He was [00:56:40] like, I just, I just don't think that this is, It's not the direction, you know, [00:56:45] because there were others in the class who, their facilities were incredible, but I could, I can [00:56:50] move with them and stuff.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:56:51] Johnny: But when you, if you put like a, you zoom into like my feet, [00:56:55] the point is not correct. Turnouts not there. So, but, and I'm so happy that I [00:57:00] stayed at Sylvia's. I'm so happy that I did, you know, I, [00:57:05] I did the graphic design course, for instance, you know, so I would say, [00:57:10] I'm just, I'm going with it as it comes. And I don't [00:57:15] think I would.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:15] Johnny: I would change anything because getting, like getting to do Moulin Rouge and [00:57:20] stuff like that was amazing. I feel like it was like the, [00:57:25] I want to say amalgamation, like the pull in of like everything from before. Like I was, I [00:57:30] was always training my voice during Hamilton, doing the most for no reason because I'm in the ensemble.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:34] Johnny: [00:57:35] You know, they weren't, nobody was hearing me, but backstage I was doing voice exercises and, [00:57:40] and you know, and then cut to a couple of years later. Now you have to do the thing and you're at [00:57:45] the top of your range, so here we go, you know, so it's always been, so I feel like [00:57:50] I'm, I'm on the journey and, um, I'm always trying to put the [00:57:55] best foot forward at each point.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:56] Johnny: So wherever that lands me, that's it. You &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:58] Claire: are only [00:58:00] ever the sum of your parts so far. Yeah, yeah. So that's, that's why I love [00:58:05] these stories because I think we see from where you are now that [00:58:10] this moment is the sum of all the parts that have come so far. Right. Really fantastic.

&lt;h3 data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;Episode Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:00] Lorna: I was on my knees. It was one of the most shattering jobs I've ever done. If you give the clear [00:00:05] on the doors when they're not shut and the automation press go, the whole [00:00:10] thing just goes. London has one of the most [00:00:15] incredible theater seats. I defy anyone not To be excited to build a show from the [00:00:20] beginning is amazing, and to be part of that, to walk into a room where you have no idea what's [00:00:25] gonna happen and.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:26] Lorna: Six weeks later you've got a show. That's incredible. Today &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:29] Claire: we're talking [00:00:30] to Lorna Cobbold, a company stage manager with nearly three decades of [00:00:35] experience in performing arts. Lorna has worked at every major [00:00:40] theatre you can possibly name and all around the world and worked with some amazing &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:44] Lorna: [00:00:45] people. I mean we're there for the audience and that's what we're doing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:00:48] Lorna: doing with telling a story for [00:00:50] people. I mean, if it wasn't for the audience, I mean, we might as well go home. If you can ever get to a [00:00:55] Sitzprobe, if anybody can talk you into a Sitzprobe, just go to one. And by [00:01:00] the interval, I was in tears. I mean, it was just heartbreaking. The atmosphere is [00:01:05] set and that's what music does to you.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:06] Lorna: And that's amazing. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:09] Oren: Hello [00:01:10] and welcome to the Five Minute Call. This is a podcast where we take a deep dive into the [00:01:15] stories of the people that make theatre &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:16] Claire: happen. I think you'll really enjoy the conversation. We're all about [00:01:20] people's stories and how they came to be in the position they're in in the [00:01:25] theatre industry at the moment.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:26] Claire: Would you tell us where you started your journey with theatre? [00:01:30] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:30] Lorna: I started, I didn't know, what [00:01:35] stage management was, which is what I do. Do I need to tell you what I do? Yeah, that's probably a good [00:01:40] start. So, uh, I'm a, so I am a company [00:01:45] and stage manager and I went to a school that didn't do drama, [00:01:50] but you could do a bit of acting and I went and I directed a show, [00:01:55] um, at school and.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:01:58] Lorna: It won a prize and [00:02:00] I enjoyed it. Just rewind over &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:02:01] Claire: that. What makes you want to get up and direct straight [00:02:05] away? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:02:05] Lorna: Um, because at 17 you can do anything. [00:02:10] And it was, I went to one of those schools that had houses [00:02:15] and there was an inter house drama competition and I was head of my house and [00:02:20] I think I was the only person in the sixth form in my house who'd [00:02:25] even done any, I'd done.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:02:27] Lorna: I did some Lambda acting. [00:02:30] Fortunately, not many people have seen that, so that's good. Um, but I did a bit of acting, [00:02:35] um, and somebody had to do it. And I, it was amazing. [00:02:40] I went off to Samuel French, which still existed back then, to find a [00:02:45] play. And somebody there must have said there's a box under [00:02:50] there for things to do with at school.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:02:52] Lorna: And I found a Willie Russell play, [00:02:55] um, which I should have remembered what it's called. And it was about, um, [00:03:00] A class and I think somebody's done something wrong and they had a kind of jury or [00:03:05] something Um, and being very practical which has lent me into the next [00:03:10] part of my job Um, it was set in a school so we could wear school uniform and I could [00:03:15] the set could be desks and as it was In a school.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:03:17] Lorna: I mean it was pretty [00:03:20] basic as to be able to put it on and The note I got [00:03:25] at the end was upstage centre is more, is better than downstage centre. [00:03:30] Uh, cause my lead was always front and centre. [00:03:35] Um, I didn't know about the, you know, Laurence Olivier. Spot back then. [00:03:40] Um, and I did that and I think I enjoyed it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:03:42] Lorna: Um, and I wanted to go to art [00:03:45] school and I wanted to, um, maybe be a designer. I quite [00:03:50] like the idea of theater design, but I more like the idea of art school and that [00:03:55] sounded and to do a foundation and my friends were all at the art block and it was the nice place [00:04:00] to be at school. And my mom and dad said, you should probably get a degree.[00:04:05] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:04:05] Lorna: And then I thought, okay, well, what am I going to get a degree in? [00:04:10] Um, I had no idea. And I had a [00:04:15] teacher who said, why don't you do a drama degree? And that sounded like a good idea. [00:04:20] I liked plays and I'd done a bit of acting and I'd done this. Um, and then I [00:04:25] discovered to do a drama degree, you needed an English A level, which I wasn't doing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:04:29] Lorna: So I swapped all my [00:04:30] A levels around and I did English in a year so I could do drama. Um, and I went to Manchester [00:04:35] to At Manchester, I met a man called Michael Holt. [00:04:40] Michael Holt is a, I say is, I hope [00:04:45] still is, he's a designer and he designed for Alan Aitbourne. Um, and he [00:04:50] was one of my tutors, and I designed a show at, [00:04:55] uh, Manchester, and it wasn't very good.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:04:57] Lorna: Um, and he said, [00:05:00] you'll never be a designer, but what you will be [00:05:05] is a very good stage manager. And because you have a way of talking to actors [00:05:10] and you have a way of explaining ideas, um, but you don't have the [00:05:15] imagination to be a designer. And I said, well, that sounds pretty great. What is [00:05:20] stage management?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:05:21] Lorna: No idea at all. Um, and I [00:05:25] carried on doing my degree and I thought I would become John Pilger and I wanted to make [00:05:30] documentaries that would change the world. And, um, [00:05:35] My first job out of university was in a PR firm and I absolutely loathed it. It was [00:05:40] just hideous. So I left and went to sell ice creams and programs at [00:05:45] the Royal Court Theatre.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:05:46] Lorna: And I was an usher there. And I said to Bo [00:05:50] Barton, who was the production manager there, who I think went on to run Lambda or RADA, [00:05:55] um, that I'd quite like to get into stage management. And [00:06:00] she gave me a work placement upstairs [00:06:05] at the Royal Court with a young director [00:06:10] who was just starting out at the Royal Court called Ian Rickson.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:06:13] Lorna: Who, ridiculously, I'm now [00:06:15] doing a show with. Uh, it was the first play of a new [00:06:20] playwright called Joe Penhall. Um, it was called Some Voices. [00:06:25] And It was my first sort of foray into, [00:06:30] um, theater and I was the work experience before that, [00:06:35] because back then to get a job, you needed an equity card. Cause I'm that old and you had to [00:06:40] have 13 weeks to get a job.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:06:42] Lorna: And Beau said, I can't give you a job cause you don't have a card and you [00:06:45] get into that catch 22. So before my work placement, I did the thing that [00:06:50] everybody tells you to do, and I wrote 50 letters. There used to be a book called contacts. [00:06:55] And in it, somebody went through for me and ticked all the people who would have equity [00:07:00] contracts.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:07:00] Lorna: And I sent 50 letters. And there was a woman who ran [00:07:05] a outdoor Shakespeare company back before everyone was doing it. [00:07:10] And she said that she would give me an equity contract, but she wouldn't pay me. [00:07:15] So I could get my leg. on the ladder, my foot on the ladder, my leg on the ladder, my foot on [00:07:20] the ladder. Um, and I drove a van and I put speakers [00:07:25] up outside and I took soaking wet costumes to the [00:07:30] laundrette in poor, where were we?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:07:33] Lorna: Plymouth. We played [00:07:35] outdoors in Plymouth. It was amazing. Um, we stayed in cool sand [00:07:40] and the sea wall, it was incredible, but it pissed with rain and they were all in, what were [00:07:45] we doing? Taming of the Shrew. Um, and they were all in. [00:07:50] And they all got soaking wet and I laundrette. Um, but I did [00:07:55] sort of, we went to the Isle of Wight, that was really cool.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:07:58] Lorna: And [00:08:00] Stourhead was quite creepy. So I was there and I got taught how to [00:08:05] cable. And I organised a few bits and pieces and I loaded a [00:08:10] van. And then I went off to the Royal Court. And I did this show for, [00:08:15] um, a stage manager who's called, um, Sheena Linden, and [00:08:20] throughout my career, people I've met have looked after me and Sheena was the first person to sort [00:08:25] of guide me through.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:08:25] Lorna: And to this day, I still do a lot of things that she told me. [00:08:30] Um, and I did. So I was work experience on that. And then. [00:08:35] I got, I'd sort of done a few interviews. I wasn't, [00:08:40] nothing really happening. Um, and the Nuffield, [00:08:45] which was still a producing rep theatre back then, [00:08:50] um, called and said, we need an ASM tomorrow.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:08:54] Lorna: [00:08:55] And I said, yes. And I got on a train and Southampton for three months and I [00:09:00] learned my trade. I learned how to prop. Um, I learned what propping was. I [00:09:05] learned what stage management was. I learned what paperwork was. I had brilliant people, a [00:09:10] friend to this day, an ASM with me who taught me, or [00:09:15] told me what I had to do, all the people around me, and I learnt.[00:09:20] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:21] Lorna: And then after that, I got a job as an ASM in Chichester. [00:09:25] We're doing the Hothouse with Harold Pinter in it. [00:09:30] And that took me to the Comedy Theatre eventually after a mini tour. And [00:09:35] weirdly, sitting here now, as I am at the Comedy Theatre, It's, uh, yeah, [00:09:40] it's been quite a journey. That sounds an &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:42] Oren: incredible journey.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:43] Oren: And I, I just wanted to go [00:09:45] back and clarify, Some we have some young listeners. Yeah, I might not actually know what stage management [00:09:50] is Give us to explain. I know so this is what give us the the [00:09:55] cliff notes rundown of stage man. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:09:56] Lorna: So what does stage management do? We make sure that everything is [00:10:00] on stage, ready to go for the performance.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:10:03] Lorna: So an act, all an actor has to do is [00:10:05] walk on stage and act and everything is there set up for them, ready to go. That starts in [00:10:10] rehearsal. So in rehearsal, um, first day of rehearsal, [00:10:15] you have a script. Hopefully, not all the time, [00:10:20] but you have a script. Um, you go through the script and you write [00:10:25] down all the props you think.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:10:26] Lorna: Props being glasses, um, anything that anybody might [00:10:30] pick up, use, uh, furniture, and you get an idea of what you're going to need for [00:10:35] the show. You also have a model box, which the designer has [00:10:40] put together. And you look at the model box, and if the script says it's set in a, uh, 14th [00:10:45] century palazzo and you look at the model box and it's set in a travel lodge you know that [00:10:50] you've moved concepts and you look at your props list and go probably don't need the [00:10:55] chandelier and you look at the the model box and you [00:11:00] write down everything that's in it and you've then got an idea of what you need for the show [00:11:05] and then depending on where you're doing that show and what the budget is you either then go and find all [00:11:10] those things or you work with a props buyer and [00:11:15] your job then is for in the rehearsal room if the props buyer's given you your [00:11:20] restaurant in the travel lodge and the actor then in rehearsal says [00:11:25] i think i'll be eating breakfast you then go to the props bar and say we're gonna [00:11:30] it's gonna be breakfast so we need coffee jugs and we need this so you're kind of [00:11:35] the conduit from what's happening in the rehearsal [00:11:40] With the designer who'll tell you that the coffee mugs need to be this, or [00:11:45] And it's, you're sort of part of a team of people making the physical [00:11:50] production, I think.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:11:51] Lorna: That be a way of describing? So that's one side of it. Then the [00:11:55] other side of it is you're I suppose you're just supporting the actors [00:12:00] in what they need to do in a practical way. Um, [00:12:05] I use the word practical an awful lot, but I think we're the practical side of theatre. [00:12:10] But I do think we also have an understanding of story and, [00:12:15] and why certain things are chosen, or you might still Depending on [00:12:20] the, how your rehearsal room is working, you might have an opportunity to offer up ideas [00:12:25] of, do you think you'd have this at that point?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:12:27] Lorna: Or would you have a notebook? Or what would [00:12:30] that notebook be? And if you're doing something, I mean, I [00:12:35] start, I started having to prop. I, we didn't have prop buyers and I loved it. I'd [00:12:40] go to markets, I'd research things. I did a play once at the Old [00:12:45] Vic with Michael Pennington and I was the only member of stage management.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:12:48] Lorna: and he was playing Chekhov, [00:12:50] and I went to a Russian library to find the right [00:12:55] paperwork that Chekhov would have on his desk. You get to go to amazing places. [00:13:00] Um, did a play about a lawyer who was an MP, so I went to Parliament and looked at [00:13:05] lots of bits and pieces. I did a show at the Don [00:13:10] Mark or Frost Nixon.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:13:11] Lorna: And one of the scenes was as an aeroplane and I went off to a [00:13:15] salvage place in the back of beyond and found some BA seats in an old [00:13:20] burnt out aeroplane. And that's what you did. And it was, it was [00:13:25] amazing fun. It was great. These days, somebody else gets to do most of that fun and you sit in a rehearsal room and [00:13:30] just feed out and feed in the ideas.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:13:33] Lorna: And then I guess the other part of stage management is [00:13:35] on the night. of the play. Um, you set [00:13:40] everything up. You have huge checklists to make sure everything's there. And [00:13:45] once the curtain is up, and the play is on, you might have what we call cues. So [00:13:50] maybe an actor comes off, um, and you hand them something.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:13:53] Lorna: Or you shine a torch [00:13:55] so they don't walk into a wall. Or you, those sort of bits and pieces. And then there might be, [00:14:00] A scene change, and you might go on in the pitch dark, which I'm doing at the moment. [00:14:05] Trying not to fall off the front of the stage, moving things around. Um, or it might be old school and you [00:14:10] bring in this front cloth or something comes in, and then you all dive on behind it and you move everything around.[00:14:15] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:16] Lorna: And you change the scene. So that's sort of, I think that's [00:14:20] stage management. It's, yeah. I mean, if you tell &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:22] Claire: us it's stage management, I'm going to believe you on it [00:14:25] because, because you've done it quite &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:26] Lorna: a lot. Well, I mean, I've always made it up as I've [00:14:30] gone along, because I, nobody's ever really told me what it was, and I didn't spend, I didn't go [00:14:35] to drama school, and I didn't learn, I just learn on the job, and there's a lot of things I don't know, [00:14:40] so, um, I've had to pick it up, and I've made some classic mistakes, [00:14:45] because I never got, I think a lot of stage management courses, you get a bit of [00:14:50] technical stuff too, I mean, I thought a fairy light was a fairy light and I didn't understand [00:14:55] why you needed an operator for fairy lights.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:14:57] Lorna: Um, I've had people tell me that curtains are in, [00:15:00] you have curtains at home and you have drapes or I wore my [00:15:05] terminology and all of that I've just learnt and I'm not hugely technical. [00:15:10] Um, I don't know if that's something, but I've, but I've learnt what I need to know. [00:15:15] Um, and, and gone on from there. Just being quiet and watching and listening and seeing how it [00:15:20] works, um, I think is huge.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:15:23] Lorna: One of the best, one of my [00:15:25] first ever jobs, um, was a, it might have even been my [00:15:30] first ever job. I was an ASM on a, an opera. [00:15:35] at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and I'd never done it before, and I was [00:15:40] just sort of trying to find my way through. And it had a [00:15:45] really smart, the crew were from Glyndebourne, so they were all over it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:15:48] Lorna: They were brilliant, [00:15:50] and you learn from everybody, and stage management and crew are like [00:15:55] that. One just has management in the title. It's the same kind of gig. [00:16:00] Um, and he said to me, the one thing. How did [00:16:05] he phrase it? There's nothing wrong with please and [00:16:10] It was just such a simple thing. Because everybody is working [00:16:15] together and if you think that word management in your title means that you're any better than that [00:16:20] guy who's been doing it for, you know, can move this to career in 20 minutes and [00:16:25] get it up and running, no.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:16:26] Lorna: And it's just a really good leveller. [00:16:30] The theatre is such a group of people all working together. Um, I thought [00:16:35] that was really good. That's just a great bit of early doors advice, [00:16:40] um, and yeah, I'm a watcher and a listener and I think particularly in, [00:16:45] so a rehearsal room has a very strange, [00:16:50] to learn how to be in a rehearsal room just takes sort of [00:16:55] experience and listening and sitting and when to move [00:17:00] and when to, I mean it sounds ridiculous, uh, there's so many people [00:17:05] pretending to be other people and telling stories but there is a sort of, um, [00:17:10] way of not breaking a moment if somebody's an actor's finding something [00:17:15] or a director's on a role or you, you don't want to be the person that breaks an idea [00:17:20] or, um, and I think you learn a lot of that from just watching [00:17:25] and listening.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:28] Lorna: You still enjoy &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:29] Claire: [00:17:30] the storytelling? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:31] Lorna: Yeah, I do. Um, I've always been, I've [00:17:35] always asked for a script before I take a job. I mean, unless [00:17:40] it's Sure. [00:17:45] Um, but New Place, I quite like to, I love being sent a script and, and seeing how [00:17:50] we're going to do it. Have I ever turned down a job when I've read a script? No. No.[00:17:55] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:17:55] Lorna: Um, I have turned down, um, I was [00:18:00] offered to do, I mean, turning down work as a freelancer is insane. [00:18:05] I mean, insane, but, um, there are things that just don't float your boat [00:18:10] and you just know that you're not going to be very good at. And I think if you enjoy the story you're telling, [00:18:15] you're better at your job.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:18:16] Lorna: And I remember going, being asked if I would take [00:18:20] always forget its name. Sending the Clowns is the [00:18:25] musical. Night music. I was asked to do a little night music to bring it out of. [00:18:30] the Chocolate Factory and take it into the West End and I said categorically, no I'm not doing that. [00:18:35] I went to see it at the National and everybody loved it at the National and Judi Dench was singing and it was [00:18:40] amazing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:18:40] Lorna: I was like, this is awful. Oh, why am I here? [00:18:45] And I'd taken my mum and dad and it was going to be this huge thing and we all sat there and went, oh god, what [00:18:50] is this? So when I was asked to do it, I went, yeah, no, sorry, it's not my thing. [00:18:55] Maybe I'm just one of those people who doesn't do Sondheim, I don't know.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:18:59] Lorna: The producer said, [00:19:00] you've got to go and see it at the chocolate factory. Just go and see it. And then you can tell me you're not going to do it. So I [00:19:05] went to see it. God, it was brilliant. It was so good. And [00:19:10] I took it into town and I got my mom and dad to come and see it. And they're like, Oh no, it's that thing we saw at the [00:19:15] national, isn't it?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:19:16] Lorna: No, no, you should just come, just come. And they talk about it to this day. It was great. [00:19:20] And what do you put that down to? The two different, uh, [00:19:25] different, uh, different interpretation of, [00:19:30] um, a piece. It's a different way of telling a story and one that [00:19:35] was, you could understand it, I guess, or, or actually hear the [00:19:40] lyrics I think is, So important with some time and maybe I hadn't [00:19:45] heard the lyrics and the original or I mean, it's hilarious Some of that [00:19:50] musical.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:19:50] Lorna: I mean, it's brilliant. You're clearly quite reverent about &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:19:53] Claire: that You know listening [00:19:55] to you talk about how to be in a &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:19:56] Lorna: rehearsal room now. Yes, I think I am [00:20:00] actually Yeah, I think oh, I think I have respect for actors. Yeah and [00:20:05] performers I think what they do is and how they put themselves out there [00:20:10] and I think I don't stand in front of all those people and pretend to be somebody else.[00:20:15] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:20:15] Lorna: I mean, for ent for our entertainment, or for our thoughts, or, [00:20:20] um, I think it's amazing what they do. Um, so I think you should [00:20:25] I mean, an element of reverence. Let's not go crazy here. [00:20:30] They're not And you like to think you might be [00:20:35] I think one of the Are you changing the world? Well, you might be [00:20:40] changing somebody's thought.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:20:41] Lorna: You might be making somebody's It's happier, sadder, might be giving [00:20:45] somebody to think about something. I think you have to think of it like that. [00:20:50] Um, but yes, I have, I have huge respect for what they do. So &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:20:54] Claire: at some [00:20:55] point, and actually very quickly looking at your incredible resume here, it [00:21:00] changes slightly from stage management to company management, company [00:21:05] stage management.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:06] Lorna: Um, when I remember meeting my first company manager as [00:21:10] an ASM and I thought, God, that is a terrible job. You wouldn't want to do that. [00:21:15] I mean, here I am creating art and finding the right prop from the right [00:21:20] era. This is what it's all about. And that, and they, and standing in a dinner jacket, I [00:21:25] mean, company managers back then, dinner jacket, wandering around showing people.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:29] Lorna: And [00:21:30] I still worrying about radiators and people's dressing rooms. I was. [00:21:35] How dire. Um, I've been doing it for quite a long time. [00:21:40] I still worry about radiators as part of radiators cars. Yeah. Um, [00:21:45] uh, I, So again, going back to people who don't [00:21:50] know much about stage management, there are three, maybe four members of a stage management team.[00:21:55] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:21:55] Lorna: You're an ASM on a play. There's probably one of you on a large musical. There might be [00:22:00] four of you. There might be, I think there's a magic show that has nine. Um, [00:22:05] so you're the nuts and bolts, um, of making it happen. Then you have [00:22:10] a deputy stage manager who I have such admiration [00:22:15] for and all for, because I've done it and it's, I was.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:18] Lorna: Terrible. It's [00:22:20] just not my gig. Um, and the people who do that, and there are some killer [00:22:25] DSMs out there and, uh, they are essentially the captain of the ship. So [00:22:30] they sit and watch the show on a screen, [00:22:35] multiple cameras, depending on what, how big the show is and what's happening. They have the script in front [00:22:40] of them.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:22:40] Lorna: They have all the lighting cues, all the sound cues, uh, automation, whatever it [00:22:45] is. And they literally press go on the show and run it the whole way through. [00:22:50] The rest of us are in their hands. That's, you might be the stage [00:22:55] manager and technically above them, but the, but the DSM in my view, [00:23:00] runs that shit for you on a nightly basis.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:23:02] Lorna: And you kind of dip in and out when you're [00:23:05] needed. And should it all go pear shaped, you dive in, um, [00:23:10] and then you, and the stage manager is weirdly, [00:23:15] I guess, in the hierarchy above that, and they keep an eye on everything. Um, and they're usually eyes and ears [00:23:20] by that point, and you're on the deck just making sure that everything is smooth, running [00:23:25] smoothly.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:23:26] Lorna: On a play, you're pretty much doing very little. On a large musical, [00:23:30] you think of the great, huge shows with incredible stage managers who are watching. [00:23:35] What's the show, um, Huge automated pieces, Lord [00:23:40] of the Rings or something that these, all these things move around and things are flying in. Um, I [00:23:45] think the biggest show.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:23:46] Lorna: I was an ASM on [00:23:50] Showboat. It was one of my first ever big musicals. It was at the [00:23:55] Prince Edward, and it was a live event production. It'd come over from America, and it was huge. And we had, [00:24:00] we had cars flying in, and we had, well, we had the [00:24:05] boat. And then we had a street scene, and the whole, I mean, it was vast.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:24:09] Lorna: It was [00:24:10] vast. I caused it to stop a couple of times, but that's another story. Um, so [00:24:15] they keep an eye on all of that and they are everybody feet, the head of automation feeds into them and [00:24:20] everybody feeds into them. Um, and then you get a company manager who worries about [00:24:25] radiators and, um, looks after is the pastoral care, I guess.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:24:29] Lorna: [00:24:30] Um, but also generally does the payroll, uh, and, and [00:24:35] is really the line between it's a hard, it's quite hard. Because [00:24:40] you are, you're the company's representative to the producer, but you're [00:24:45] also the producer's representative to the company. So you have to sort of find [00:24:50] that middle ground where you're looking after both interests.[00:24:55] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:24:55] Lorna: And, but you're with the comp, despite it being a slightly office y role, [00:25:00] sort of, uh, in America they do it differently, over here you are at the theatre. [00:25:05] Whenever there's a show on. So you're the person that finds a plaster when that needs to [00:25:10] happen or You you just [00:25:15] try and you look after actors you look after the technical team You [00:25:20] you sort of I guess try and keep everything on track to net [00:25:25] and everybody in a reasonably good place [00:25:30] on a play, you combine the two roles of company and stage manager, because there's not a huge [00:25:35] amount of stage management to do, often.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:25:36] Lorna: I tried to be a DSM, because that's what you do after you, and I brought a [00:25:40] flying piece in on Michael Gambon's head. He was really polite about it, um, [00:25:45] but, um, he, yeah, he just sort of did, bent down a bit, um, [00:25:50] he was an absolute delight. I describe it as, if you, if you're a [00:25:55] DSM, you see in black and white, and if you're a company manager, company stage manager, you see in grey.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:25:59] Lorna: [00:26:00] So, you're a bit bigger picture, whereas you've got to be completely, [00:26:05] um, it's either right or wrong. Is there a lot of pressure to that? To being a DSM? [00:26:10] Yeah. Oh my god, it must heinous! Can you imagine calling something like, I don't know, [00:26:15] um, oh, New York on Spider Man. They had two DSMs, I think, because [00:26:20] there was one person just couldn't call it all.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:26:22] Lorna: Uh, what, Wicked you must be calling people who are [00:26:25] flying. Uh, Harry Potter, uh, I mean, you have to learn both shows. I think that's massive. [00:26:30] I think what, yeah, I mean, talk to, talk to a DSM. I don't know. Um, they might think it's [00:26:35] just run of the mill in the way that, you know, if somebody else is doing a job, um, [00:26:40] like a heart surgeon probably goes, I don't know, it's easy, but brain surgery, shit.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:26:43] Lorna: Takes a different set of [00:26:45] skills, right? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:26:46] Claire: And an ability not, not to be frightened that you're going to make a mistake. I would [00:26:50] imagine, &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:26:50] Lorna: because as soon as you're frightened of that, It comes to, I think they always say, just keep [00:26:55] talking. If you're learning a book, which is learning to be a DSM, they just say, [00:27:00] and everything's written down.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:27:01] Lorna: So if it's all written down, you don't have to remember it, but you just have to [00:27:05] keep talking. If you go, oh no, shit, I fucked that, oh no, quick. Because it's just, [00:27:10] once the, once you've opened, once the curtain is up, it is not going to stop. [00:27:15] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:27:15] Oren: So this is a really interesting topic because [00:27:20] from the audience perspective you don't know when things are going wrong And yeah, you shouldn't really know when things are going on unless they've [00:27:25] gone really wrong So we know sort of what a good show looks like but what happens if something does go [00:27:30] wrong?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:27:30] Lorna: Well, I probably shouldn't admit this publicly, but I did cause Lion King to come to a grinding [00:27:35] halt Um, there is a and it probably doesn't it doesn't do this [00:27:40] anymore. I was on Lion King just after it opened So what are we talking 30 years ago? [00:27:45] It's just had its something. Um, and I went in as an ASM dep, [00:27:50] and I'm sure this queue doesn't exist anymore.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:27:52] Lorna: But in London, which I don't think it does on tour, [00:27:55] the wildebeest come up through the floor move fast, it gets trampled to death. So there was a [00:28:00] queue, isn't it? They used to be a queue. There are three lefts and you'd, [00:28:05] you're dressed in blacks. You're a. And you've got your headset on. 'cause you talk to everybody and they put [00:28:10] over a wildebeest sort of rug that goes over [00:28:15] you so that you can come up behind the wildebeest.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:28:19] Lorna: You're coming up to [00:28:20] the center of the stage behind the wildebeest as an a SM. [00:28:25] And before you come, you've got all, uh, your sub stage. So all the will to be slowed in. [00:28:30] And then three doors have to close. And the queue used to be to give the clear. [00:28:35] So, you give the clear to automation that all three [00:28:40] doors are closed.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:28:40] Lorna: Doors are closed, you're ready to move. You then come up behind the [00:28:45] wildebeest, and they're doing all their thing, and then you walk to the edge of the stage, and you [00:28:50] Unhook a flying piece. Uh, it's a, uh, hook up for a foy flying. [00:28:55] You then have to walk up these steps and come behind Simba, [00:29:00] hook him up, tap him to tell him he's hooked up, tell the [00:29:05] DSM on your headset that you're clear, and get off.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:09] Lorna: [00:29:10] I've had friends in, and it's so embarrassing, that thing I have to do, and they go, What thing? You know when the [00:29:15] wildebeest are doing the thing, and the, with the No, I didn't see you. What? But I Nobody sees you [00:29:20] doing it. Yeah, no. So you do that. If you give the [00:29:25] clear on the doors when they're not shut, and the automation press go, [00:29:30] the whole thing just goes And the front cloth comes in.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:34] Lorna: Ladies and [00:29:35] gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry, we're having technical difficulties. It's just me. Is this hypothetical, Lorna? [00:29:40] You're talking about hypothetical. If that were to happen, this is what would happen. Good God, what, [00:29:45] what's gone, what's happened? What's happened? Oh god, was it me? It's probably me. Oh, fuck.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:49] Lorna: It was me [00:29:50] And once it's [00:29:55] that shit happens Sorry, I probably shouldn't say it like that. No, it's &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:29:59] Oren: great. It's [00:30:00] honest. What's the recovery? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:30:02] Lorna: Um, massive embarrassment. [00:30:05] Um, and huge, just, I'm really sorry. I just, [00:30:10] I thought it, people make mistakes. Yeah, yeah. And there [00:30:15] with the big musicals and a lot and big shows, your, your contingencies are so fast.[00:30:20] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:30:21] Lorna: Um, and we were up and running in two minutes. I mean, everyone goes, [00:30:25] okay, shut, right. Reload. Let's do the doors. Automation. Take it in. Yeah, I'm good. Everybody's set. Right. [00:30:30] We're going back to here. DSM. Who is going, right, we'll go from here. So they tell the band, [00:30:35] right, we're going to go from this bar. They tell the lighting.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:30:37] Lorna: I'm going to go from here. They tell Sam, we're going to go from here. They tell automation. We're going to go [00:30:40] from there. Everything's sharp. Bang. Let's do it again. Okay, here we go. And it all [00:30:45] starts and probably people will have noticed, but they will have forgotten [00:30:50] by the end. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Oh yeah.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:30:52] Lorna: Yeah. And again, depping on that show, I think it's one of the last [00:30:55] places that has that last Pride Rock comes out at the end. One time I was doing it [00:31:00] and it didn't happen. All the animals come on and it's a beautiful ending. Ah, isn't the music great? [00:31:05] I said to a friend, oh, it's just, you know, no Pride Rock now.[00:31:10] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:10] Lorna: If you don't know it's supposed to be there, it's fine. You can [00:31:15] get away with quite a lot. Yeah. So having &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:18] Claire: told us that company [00:31:20] manager appeared to be the most boring job in the world, you nonetheless have &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:24] Lorna: [00:31:25] done it for a long time. It's very rare that I'm just a company manager. [00:31:30] Um, I've done that twice. To build a show from the beginning is [00:31:35] amazing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:35] Lorna: And to be part of that. Yeah. To walk into a room where you have no idea what's going to happen. [00:31:40] And six weeks later, you've got a show. That's incredible. And to be part of that. And as a company [00:31:45] manager, you are. Keep your feeding everything in and you're getting people to talk to each [00:31:50] other, which is a sort of element of the stage manager in it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:31:53] Lorna: And then when the show [00:31:55] is up and running, yeah, see, I'm rarely just a company manager. So I've [00:32:00] sort of on the deck and I hear, I hear it and I see it. [00:32:05] And I like to walk out into the audience and at the beginning, um, and get an [00:32:10] idea of people excited. What's it feel like out there in the interval, all that kind of [00:32:15] stuff.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:15] Lorna: Um, I think you're just part of this amazing machine. [00:32:20] It took quite a few years before you &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:22] Claire: moved from plays &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:23] Lorna: into musical theatre. Yes. [00:32:25] But then you've &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:25] Claire: done a lot of musical theatre. Yes. Um, could you talk to us about the [00:32:30] differences between the &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:31] Lorna: two? One's better paid. [00:32:35] LAUGHTER Which was my initial move into musical theatre.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:32:38] Lorna: OK. Um, [00:32:40] uh, I had a lovely time putting on plays and they were great. I was [00:32:45] skint. Um, and the reason they pay more is because they're [00:32:50] much harder. Um, there are more people involved. Well, uh, [00:32:55] Generally, unless you're doing a sort of boutique Um, but there [00:33:00] are, you also have to look after, so one of the things a company manager does is [00:33:05] schedule.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:06] Lorna: Um, I quite like it. It's about sort of time [00:33:10] Tetris and who can do what, when, and you've got to, so on a musical, a company [00:33:15] manager probably spends most of their time trying to plan the next day because you have got wig [00:33:20] fittings, uh, costume fittings, somebody's being measured. a [00:33:25] vocal coach is coming in. Um, you need dialect maybe.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:29] Lorna: Uh, there might be [00:33:30] a fight. Um, the range of people who are [00:33:35] involved more often than not in a musical is pretty vast. So for every scene there is a [00:33:40] song and for every song there's probably a number, a dance. So [00:33:45] that's three disciplines that have to happen for one scene. So it's busier. [00:33:50] Um, it takes more, more organization.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:33:53] Lorna: You've got three directors you have to [00:33:55] look after. There's generally more people in it. [00:34:00] Um, and then you throw, once you've done all of that, then you throw in a band as [00:34:05] well on top of that. Um, And I'm not very musical. So it was a, quite a learning [00:34:10] curve for me to learn about bands and MDs. And so I, [00:34:15] and to learn orchestration, that was astonishing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:34:18] Lorna: I mean, I [00:34:20] have been incredibly fortunate to be in a room with Bill Brown. Bill Brown [00:34:25] was, Oh, he was just this incredible. Man who [00:34:30] made movement, music into movement, movement into music. Um, [00:34:35] and I've watched him watch a rehearsal of an [00:34:40] actor, um, who was Barnum, doing a [00:34:45] number, and then he went away and put that, that actor's movements.[00:34:50] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:34:52] Lorna: I mean, the hair's on the back of your neck. I mean, it was [00:34:55] incredible to watch him work. Um, watch him, listen to him work, and he was a really nice man. [00:35:00] So to un and what I've enjoyed about musicals is learning more and more about the [00:35:05] music. I still don't know very much, and I still rely heavily on a DSM, who, [00:35:10] if they're on a musical, can probably read music.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:35:12] Lorna: And, I can hear if a If the [00:35:15] band's going a bit off, but they're, the DSM will go, Oh, that thing with the third bar with the yada [00:35:20] yada and be like, okay, yeah, I didn't really notice [00:35:25] that. But I can hear, you know, a flat tuba. [00:35:30] Um, and. Yeah, they're just bigger, generally, [00:35:35] because there are more people involved, because there are more disciplines involved.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:35:38] Lorna: And do you find that exciting? [00:35:40] Uh, yes and no. Um, do I find [00:35:45] Yes, I do. Well, I kind of like to do both. I'm just greedy that way. [00:35:50] Um, I love being in a room that's just all about words, and then, uh [00:35:55] Um, we did a sing through for cabaret at [00:36:00] the end of, I guess, the first two weeks. And you're in a room [00:36:05] with all these actors, just with a piano, and they sing through the whole [00:36:10] play.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:36:12] Lorna: And by the interval I was in tears. I mean, it was [00:36:15] just heartbreaking. Um, and that's what music does to you. And that's the way it is. [00:36:20] Amazing. Um, a Sitzprobe. If you can ever get to a [00:36:25] Sitzprobe, if anybody can talk you into a Sitzprobe, just go to one. [00:36:30] So, for our listeners, a Sitzprobe. If you're rehearsing a [00:36:35] musical, you generally only rehearse it with a piano in the room.[00:36:40] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:36:40] Lorna: Depending on what type of musical, you might have two pianos. Um, a [00:36:45] percussionist who gives you rhythm, uh, uh, all the choreographers want you to have a, but I've done [00:36:50] a lot where it's just a piano, but in the back of your mind, there's a 20 piece orchestra [00:36:55] or there's a 10, whoever they are, however big it is.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:36:59] Lorna: The [00:37:00] Sitzprobe is the first time you take all your actors into a room and they meet the band for the first time. [00:37:05] And they listen to you. to the show for the first time and the [00:37:10] actors are blown away by the artistry of the band. The band have [00:37:15] had their own rehearsals and then again if you go back to orchestration and you see an actor, [00:37:20] if you're lucky enough to work on a musical that's being orchestrated while you work on it, you see an [00:37:25] actor listen to their movement and that's Their face [00:37:30] just explodes.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:37:31] Lorna: Oh my god, or there is a [00:37:35] An ident of something in a in the way that a character said something and they've put it into the [00:37:40] music and it's just I mean It's incredible. It's a Rare moment. [00:37:45] I've cried like a baby and quite a lot of them. It was very tired and one of them But I [00:37:50] do remember the Les Mis 02 Sitzprobe that was [00:37:55] vast.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:37:55] Lorna: Were you there for that? It was my 25th anniversary one. 25th anniversary. We did [00:38:00] the, it was the three companies at the O2, and we were at three mils doing [00:38:05] a Sitzprobe. And I was on my knees. It was one of the most shattering jobs I've ever done. [00:38:10] And, But you always try and get to the sitzprobe, because it's the [00:38:15] best thing about a musical.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:38:16] Lorna: And at the end they did the four Valjeans, um, for the first [00:38:20] time. So Um, but other times you're just like, [00:38:25] you just want to get up and dance. I mean, it's amazing. And that, I think, is The brilliance of a musical. It's [00:38:30] just watching it all come together. That one's filmed &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:38:32] Oren: as well, so &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:38:33] Lorna: He's probably me in the corner, [00:38:35] weeping.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:38:37] Oren: You should go and check it out if they, uh Oh, they [00:38:40] videoed the sets? Yeah, yeah, it's videoed. It's on the, um, I think special edition of the DVD [00:38:45] release. Yeah. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:38:47] Lorna: I think I'm on that DVD. [00:38:50] Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I like doing both, [00:38:55] but one, generally you have to sign up longer for a musical because they run longer. The other [00:39:00] thing about them is that you often can't company stage manager musical because there's too [00:39:05] much happening on the deck.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:06] Lorna: Um, and I'm sort of been lucky with the [00:39:10] times that I have company. managed only, [00:39:15] have I been lucky? Some I've been lucky with. There have been other things that have kept me interested. So [00:39:20] Les Mis in Australia, Australia kept me interested, if you see what I mean, and moving [00:39:25] around. Um, yeah. But I, yeah, what I really [00:39:30] like is a new musical in a small space.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:32] Lorna: They're the ones that are very [00:39:35] exciting. I wondered &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:36] Claire: if you feel like there's a, um, there's [00:39:40] opportunity for you to develop your own style as a stage manager or a company manager, [00:39:45] or a &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:45] Lorna: company stage manager. Yes, I think there's definitely a way of having your [00:39:50] own style. Yes. Um, I mean, a stage manager's job is a stage [00:39:55] manager's job, but there is a way and a means of doing that.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:39:57] Lorna: Um, and there's a way and I mean, as in [00:40:00] any job of running a team and being a manager, um, and you can do that [00:40:05] very different ways. Um, so yes, I think, It's absolutely [00:40:10] open to who you are and how you want to deal with it. Um, and you can bring your own [00:40:15] way of managing people or running [00:40:20] things. And was there a &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:21] Claire: moment during your career where you became aware of your &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:24] Lorna: own style?[00:40:25] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:28] Lorna: No, I have no idea how people [00:40:30] perceive me. I really don't. I mean, they do occasionally say, Oh, well, yeah, you're not on the fence about [00:40:35] that one, are you? I'm quite honest. Um, and I'm quite [00:40:40] vocal, I suppose. Um, and. [00:40:45] If people are being kind, they say, Oh, great job. Thank you. Or you did that really well. Or so [00:40:50] you, but I, I don't really know [00:40:55] what I try and do if I'm running a tech, which I really enjoy.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:40:59] Lorna: Do I need to [00:41:00] explain that for the listener? Yep.[00:41:05] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:41:05] Lorna: So we've gone from the rehearsal room. We've had a SITS probe, [00:41:10] uh, or we haven't, if it's a play and the tech. It's the first time the actors [00:41:15] stand on the physical set and the lighting designer and the sound designer [00:41:20] and all the video people, or whoever it is, get to make the show together. [00:41:25] And the person who runs that tech, in this country, is the stage manager.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:41:29] Lorna: [00:41:30] And it's your responsibility, with the DSM, to [00:41:35] gather all the information that you need. The DSM needs to run the [00:41:40] show. Um, so they're essentially doing most of the work, but you're the one on stage [00:41:45] moving it along, uh, waiting. The lighting designer will [00:41:50] be lighting a scene. You just want to go into the next scene.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:41:53] Lorna: You just need to get through it, but it's a [00:41:55] way of managing an awful lot of people and time and the actors who get really [00:42:00] bored. Cause it's not about them. Um, and. To [00:42:05] put the physical elements together. So if I run a tech, I, I try [00:42:10] and keep it reasonably jolly. I use the word jolly a lot, but it's, you know, [00:42:15] we're lighting.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:42:16] Lorna: It can be quite boring for everybody. It can be [00:42:20] frustrating. Um, sometimes you're waiting for really technical programming to [00:42:25] happen. Can we change it by a millimetre? Can it come in a bit less? Can it go out a bit more? It's not [00:42:30] working. Why isn't it working? Can we do that on that different beat? I'm going to have to add some [00:42:35] It's that sort of recipe melting pot thing that can be a bit [00:42:40] So, you just need to keep an energy in the room, I suppose.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:42:44] Lorna: [00:42:45] Um, I think I try and do that. I think I do have a style. [00:42:50] But I'm not sure I could explain it to you. I think somebody else would have to, I &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:42:54] Oren: [00:42:55] think natural just by the &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:42:56] Lorna: way you do things. I think some of it, I've [00:43:00] been doing it a long time. I think the brilliance of being an ASM and I was an ASM for a long [00:43:05] time is that you watch a stage manager.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:07] Lorna: So once you become a DSM, you're the only [00:43:10] DSM on a show. So how do you learn what other DSMs do? So when people [00:43:15] are really desperate to stop being ASMs, I say, listen, just. Use [00:43:20] it to learn what other people do and see their skills. And I've had some great [00:43:25] stage managers and I've had some great people to watch.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:27] Lorna: And I've had some incredible company managers. [00:43:30] Um, and I've learned from them. Um, [00:43:35] and I think that's really important. I [00:43:40] certainly think you have a style having worked with you. [00:43:45] And it's a &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:43:45] Claire: rather magical combination of [00:43:50] extreme efficiency and practicality. and a bucket of [00:43:55] heart and instinct. I think your instinct, certainly when we've worked together [00:44:00] with performers to support them, your instinct, you say you don't know anything about [00:44:05] music, but actually your instinct &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:06] Lorna: about the singer is.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:09] Lorna: And I think that [00:44:10] certainly watching from my viewpoint of it is, [00:44:15] is &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:15] Claire: a &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:16] Lorna: really unique style. It's not very many people. I [00:44:20] think you also learn, don't you, to how you watch people do what they do. [00:44:25] Um, and I would say probably if you talk to the company, my first [00:44:30] ever musical theatre company where we met, Um, Les Mis 25th [00:44:35] anniversary tour, and you spoke to them and then you spoke to, let's say, the company of [00:44:40] Rock Follies from this summer or Cabaret.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:44:42] Lorna: They might have completely different ideas [00:44:45] because it's, what, 20 years later. I think I have listened to people like [00:44:50] you. I've listened to musical directors. Um, I've listened to musicians. I've listened [00:44:55] to singers. Um, I learned [00:45:00] something on every job. Um, and so [00:45:05] guess instinct and learning come together a bit, I think.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:45:09] Lorna: Um, [00:45:10] and you also grow in confidence as you get older [00:45:15] in expressing what or talking to people and asking why and how. [00:45:20] And then again, experience, you see how some roles affect people. [00:45:25] So if it affects that person doing that role, maybe in this musical, musical. It's also [00:45:30] a thing. Um, yeah. Um, and I, [00:45:35] and I hope I bring a slight element of humor to it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:45:39] Lorna: [00:45:40] Otherwise it all sounds frightfully earnest and a bit dull. But maybe [00:45:45] not. Maybe I just think I'm funny. But yeah, I think if [00:45:50] you're, if you've got somebody who is, I [00:45:55] suppose that's the other thing, the other big difference is that an [00:46:00] actor doesn't have to sing. So an actor might lose their [00:46:05] voice or get ill or have a chest infection or, but there is more often [00:46:10] a way of fighting through that.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:13] Lorna: When a singer loses their [00:46:15] voice, they feel like they're losing their very being and trying to put [00:46:20] that person back together, um, and remind them that Well, [00:46:25] I always say, it's like you've twisted your ankle, it's just, it's a, [00:46:30] you haven't lost your resondetra and sometimes you just have to [00:46:35] put ice on it and put your foot up and you're doing the same thing.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:38] Lorna: But it's taken a long time to be able [00:46:40] to say that to somebody or, or, or to consider that [00:46:45] might be helpful or, and, yeah I think that's experience. But [00:46:50] you just, I mean, You talk to a lot of people and they, you just [00:46:55] learn a bit every day. What's next? &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:46:59] Oren: If [00:47:00] you're allowed to &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:47:00] Lorna: talk about it. What's next for me? Um, so I am going back to the musical world [00:47:05] I've just spent, or I am now.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:47:08] Lorna: Another great part of my job, [00:47:10] um, is I get to work on new writing. And this year, I've done three new [00:47:15] things. Um, two plays and a musical. Um, again, [00:47:20] hugely lucky to be able to fit in a musical in a year, um, between. So, [00:47:25] um, so I'm now doing a play, new writing, loving it, great team of [00:47:30] people. And then at the end of January, I fly to New York to help put on cabaret and Broadway.[00:47:35] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:47:36] Lorna: Which is pretty exciting. How does that feel? It's pretty [00:47:40] exciting. I mean, I'm hugely lucky in that I've put on a show in New York before, but in Brooklyn. [00:47:45] And it's a very different experience. style and way of doing things and I think, [00:47:50] but they were used to English companies being there, [00:47:55] but I think to be in a West, um, sorry, a Broadway house on [00:48:00] Broadway will be, I think it will be fascinating [00:48:05] because they do things so differently.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:08] Lorna: Um, [00:48:10] and I'm always, I think London is, has one of the most [00:48:15] incredible theatre scenes. And the amount of new stuff we do, or the [00:48:20] old shows that still keep running and are still good to see. And, [00:48:25] um, I think we're so lucky, national. Um, and I don't [00:48:30] know enough about American theatre, but So it will be [00:48:35] amazing to be out there and see what's there and what's on and probably won't be able to see any of that because I'll be working but, [00:48:40] but, and how they do things very differently.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:48:44] Lorna: [00:48:45] And you don't find that intimidating? No, I [00:48:50] probably, I probably find it irritating while I'm in England. Having [00:48:55] worked with some American companies who've come here, we work much [00:49:00] quicker, we're way more on the fly here, we're not so unionised [00:49:05] so we can cross pollinate with different departments doing different things, [00:49:10] so it all moves at quite a great rate, which I'm told in America everything [00:49:15] is a lot slower.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:49:16] Lorna: Um, and there is [00:49:20] less cross departmental. There is no cross departmental. [00:49:25] Um, and different people do different things. So I think it will be interesting to see. Something like Cabaret [00:49:30] just requires this mixture of front of house people [00:49:35] doing a bit of this, and then the cast doing a bit of that, and then there's [00:49:40] the prologue, and then there's the back, and it's all, I mean it's just great, kind of.[00:49:45] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:49:45] Lorna: world. Different people doing their thing to make one thing brilliant. [00:49:50] And I wonder, it'll be interesting to see how we can do that in America. Are you [00:49:55] preparing a mental strategy for that? No, I'm buying thermals. Um, [00:50:00] uh, am I provide? No, I think you just have to, well, you can't do it like you [00:50:05] want to do it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:50:06] Lorna: I mean, that's with anything, isn't it? I mean, if you're going to, [00:50:10] to arrive and go, well, you should do it like this. I mean, we did it like this. I mean, why are you doing like this? [00:50:15] Um, to anything in any job when you're taking something over or putting on. So I think you just have to go with, this [00:50:20] is sort of what we're aiming for.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:50:21] Lorna: How do we get there? Um, and this is what [00:50:25] we're trying to achieve. And this is what's exciting about it. This is what we hope you'll find exciting about [00:50:30] it. Um, and just, I think it, and you just have to be. [00:50:35] patient and see how other people do things. I mean, I've, again, been [00:50:40] incredibly lucky and put on shows in Japan and Brazil [00:50:45] and you just, just need to be there as a, you're just trying to get [00:50:50] to the right place, I think, [00:50:55] and just get the strands together, I suppose.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:50:59] Lorna: First of [00:51:00] all, &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:51:00] Oren: yeah, thank you so very much for being here. This has been really amazing, really insightful, I think, to a lot [00:51:05] of people and just another aspect of the industry that [00:51:10] Is that we can shed light on, which I think is really cool. We have a couple [00:51:15] of traditions. We would very much like to know what your five minute call [00:51:20] routine is.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:51:20] Oren: What do you do at your, at your five minute call? I [00:51:25] think, I think we know the answer. &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:51:25] Lorna: Yeah. Um, [00:51:30] well by then I've pro so as a company manager, I go around every dressing room, [00:51:35] um, to say hello. Most people I will have seen if there's a group [00:51:40] warm up, uh, so during the [00:51:45] half, and I, I suppose actually this isn't an answer because I try and get it done by the five, [00:51:50] but I make sure I see everybody every day.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:51:52] Lorna: Um, even if it's, hey, [00:51:55] how you doing? Generally, people will go, I'll always ask, are you under control? [00:52:00] Um, it's just my thing. Um, and I will do that. [00:52:05] And. That's when you catch up with people that you might not have seen, see how their day is, [00:52:10] that kind of. So that's generally my half. By the [00:52:15] five, again depending on if I'm a stage manager or not, I'm [00:52:20] probably putting on black clothes.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:52:23] Lorna: I'm finding a headset, [00:52:25] wondering if the battery's run out. At the moment I have to put on two headsets because one is [00:52:30] for the front of house, so I'm balancing that. Um, and [00:52:35] then I forget to put my torch on. Um, So I get kitted up. [00:52:40] I wear a torch around my neck and two headsets. Do you get in your Batman suit?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:52:44] Lorna: [00:52:45] I get into mine and then I'm ready to go and if I'm covering a plot I look for a bit of paper that has my cues [00:52:50] on it, um, and then I try and remember what I'm gonna do. And then I [00:52:55] head out. If I'm a company manager, uh, in the five, I'm often out front because I like to see the audience come in, [00:53:00] um, and see the house filling up.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:03] Lorna: And you [00:53:05] just hear the sort of buzz and people occasionally say things and you think, yeah, okay, that's good. [00:53:10] Um, or I just, I don't know. Otherwise I could be doing performance art. I mean, [00:53:15] we're there for the audience. Yeah. I mean, that's what we're doing. We're telling a story for people. [00:53:20] I mean, if it wasn't for the audience, we might as well go home.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:23] Lorna: Um, so it's quite [00:53:25] nice to be amongst them. And sometimes I come back and go, Oh yeah, I think they're really buzzing [00:53:30] tonight or Because again, for the actors, um, we have a [00:53:35] show relay so you can hear what's happening on stage in your dressing room. And some [00:53:40] theatres just leave it switched off until the show starts.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:53:43] Lorna: But you'll have some actors who'll always [00:53:45] say, Can we have it on the half? Because then you can hear the house fill up. Um, and you can hear that. That's the [00:53:50] best thing about Cabaret when we first, um, started. It [00:53:55] was quite close to COVID. And downstairs at Cabaret has tables. And [00:54:00] very cunningly, you can hear the tinkle of glassware.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:04] Lorna: And the, uh, [00:54:05] and of a restaurant. and Nick Lidster, [00:54:10] genius, but you walk in and there's these twinkling lights and you [00:54:15] cannot, I defy anyone not to be excited. It's just, the [00:54:20] atmosphere is set and it's just, it's a beautiful bit of theatre [00:54:25] even before you've got to the theatre. Um, so yes, in the five, [00:54:30] might be up front, probably getting ready for the show, um, [00:54:35] hopefully not dealing with some heinous disaster that has just [00:54:40] materialized and the lighting board's gone down, somebody's twisted their ankle, they [00:54:45] can't find their costume, hopefully not doing any of that.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:48] Oren: Very cool. [00:54:50] So one of the other things that we do on this podcast is we get The guest previous to [00:54:55] write a question for the current guest, and it is completely unknown to all of &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:54:59] Claire: [00:55:00] us. Is there a specific reason that you decided to make musical theatre your [00:55:05] career, and do you think it's been a &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:08] Lorna: good choice?&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:09] Lorna: Um, [00:55:10] to quantify, I haven't made musical theatre my career choice, because that [00:55:15] would be a disaster for me. Um, [00:55:20] do I, so I will just, do I think choosing musical A life [00:55:25] backstage in theatre has been a good career choice. Um, there are, [00:55:30] I think like any career, Well, I [00:55:35] think it's not a, does it say career or does it say, uh, yes.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:39] Lorna: So I don't [00:55:40] think what we do is a career. I think it's a life choice. Um, [00:55:45] because it's very hard to switch off. You don't really do it between certain hours. [00:55:50] Um, well you can, but not if you're being a company manager. Um, I've only [00:55:55] recently, quite recently learned that you can put do not disturb on your phone at night.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:55:58] Lorna: It's brilliant. And I think if [00:56:00] you are making a career. That life choice, um, [00:56:05] you, you only get one day off a week. And [00:56:10] particularly if you're in musical theatre. But in musical theatre you can book holidays. That's what a long running show does. [00:56:15] Um, you're freelance. You never quite know what's going to happen next.[00:56:20] &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:56:20] Lorna: You're only as good as your last job. Um, I think you, I just sort of, um, [00:56:25] you're going to miss the odd wedding. Um, as you, but I [00:56:30] think it's changing. I think in the years that I'm doing this, I think it's changing. And You can [00:56:35] put life a bit more into the job. Um, [00:56:40] I must really enjoy it [00:56:45] because I'm still doing it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:56:47] Lorna: And I think the, the, the big, [00:56:50] I'll also say that everybody I know in stage management sits around and works out how to get out of it. [00:56:55] That's a thing. You put a bunch of company managers in a room with a glass of wine, they all try and tell you how they're going to [00:57:00] stop doing it, what their exit strategy is, and yet they're all still there planning it.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:04] Lorna: [00:57:05] Um, wow, that's so hard. Yeah. That's for justifying your life [00:57:10] on a Monday afternoon. I can't do that. We've had &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:13] Oren: some really, really [00:57:15] hard hitting &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:15] Lorna: questions. Yeah, I just, I'm not sure I can do that. That's okay. I've had [00:57:20] some really great times. I've met some really great people. I've put on some fantastic [00:57:25] shows.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:25] Lorna: I've travelled the world. Um, I'm solvent. [00:57:30] Um, And I'm still doing it. On balance. On balance. I'd say [00:57:35] it was probably a good idea. Very good. Also, I have no other idea of what I would have done [00:57:40] otherwise. But again, also, for anybody out there who's [00:57:45] going to get into this, you make one choice just to try, [00:57:50] and then you'll get another choice.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:57:52] Lorna: There's no fixed way of doing this. [00:57:55] Something will come, and if you want to do it, do it. If you think you can do [00:58:00] it, do it. If you think you can't do it, have a go. Uh, but it just comes at you. [00:58:05] If you realise you don't like it, then just stop doing it, because it can be really hot. Fantastic advice. [00:58:10] Really &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:58:10] Oren: good &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:58:11] Lorna: advice.&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:58:11] Lorna: Brilliant. so much. No worries. Thank you. We'll give you the [00:58:15] book. God, I'm going to come up with a real corker for some person. Give us a [00:58:20] real bag. Yeah, it's Monday afternoon. Justify yourself! Thank &lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;&lt;br data-mce-fragment="1"&gt;[00:58:24] Claire: you so [00:58:25] much for watching our episode today.

&lt;h3&gt;Episode Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:00] Oren: Hello and welcome to The 5 Minute Call. This is a podcast where we take a deep dive into the stories of the people that make theatre happen. Today &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:08] Claire: we're talking to Jennifer White. Jennifer has been the musical director on many shows, I'm gonna have to read them. Les Mis, Avenue Q, Sunset Boulevard, Phantom, Parade, Cabaret, to name just a few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:20] Claire: Her roles also include musical supervisor on Cabaret, La Cage Aux Folles and 42nd Street. We are all about people's stories here and if you would tell us your &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:30] Jen: story. I remember oral tests in primary school, you know, two notes, is this one higher or lower, you know, just slightly detuned, um, and displaying some kind of aptitude for music, being given a trumpet mouthpiece to see if you can get a noise out of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:45] Jen: Um, and that was as early as primary five. Um, by primary seven, I think I had a Baritone horn, which is the, the, the viola of the brass, uh, instrument, or the brass band family. Um, that's so unfair. I love violas and viola jokes are really, really awful, but the baritone horn is a complete waste of time as a brass instrument and that's the one I've got to give up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:09] Oren: Yeah. Please don't give up your instrument. It's, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:12] Jen: it's, it's a sort of ugly big brother of the tenor horn, um, and not quite the, voluptuous beauty of a euphonium, you know, but in a similar register. Anyway, um, so yeah, playing that, um, hadn't started playing the piano at this point, um, until first year of high school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:32] Jen: I played in a school brass band, etc, etc. I was really rubbish, and so at this point, no notion whatsoever that I was going to be, um, a musician or, you know, or any interest. Um, my dad was a lawyer, I was going to be a lawyer, I thought, and then I was interested in being a pilot for a while, still am. Um, my other half bought me a flying lesson which was the most glorious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:52] Jen: Oh, that's amazing. A couple of hours I've spent. Um, uh, and yeah, still harbour, have harboured notions in my life of flying planes. It wasn't until fifth year at school that I, um, actually thought maybe music was gonna, you know, going to happen because it was starting to happen outside of school. Um, but in terms of the sort of formal education thing, um, I, I, I did my level of music in, in fifth year and then did a, I was Scottish obviously, I am Scottish, so I did a higher music in sixth year rather than any level, uh, and then went to university.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:02:23] Jen: But I really think the relevant stuff with regard to what I do now is what was happening outside of school and outside of the formal education, although there's no doubt it was backed up by that, but, um, If, if I was to get on any kind of soapbox in this environment, um, it would be, it would be about the, the breadth of musical knowledge that I think has made, my gosh, this is going to sound so presumptuous, made me the musician I am in terms of being able to hold my own in a number of different spheres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:02:56] Jen: And musical theatre, bizarrely, however much it's, um, Criticized or however much it's looked down on by, by so many other, um, areas of, of, of music and, and acting. Um, and that pains me every single time. Um, is Is, is that you actually need to have a working knowledge of so many different styles of music to be able to do it properly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:03:20] Jen: Um, I, I saw Next to Normal at the Dormer. Um, you know, it's basically a, a rock musical. You know, you get electric guitars and, and lots and lots of drums. Uh, But Follies is, is, you know, the, the, the level of pastiche that, that, that sometimes doing in Follies with regard to, to the twenties, the thirties, the forties, you know, all of these different years of music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:03:43] Jen: Jazz musicals, um, uh, folk musicals, you know, I mean, a breadth of, of, of understanding. And if you don't have that, those, those musical palettes to draw from, I don't think you can do them well or do them properly. So how did yours develop? My. best friend's dad, um, founded the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra and, um, aged 14, I was playing the piano in the background at a, at a dinner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:10] Jen: Um, uh, and this guy, John Mason, heard me playing and needed a piano player for, um, his folk group, the, the Ayr and Prestwick Real and Strathclyde Society. Um, and I had a glorious time and a very, very formative time from the age of about 14 to, uh, 18 I guess, um, before I went to university, playing piano for the Riegel and Strathclyde Society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:32] Jen: The key thing is, as the piano player, you're playing from the, the violin part, because it's a, it's like a Fiddler's Rally type thing, sort of Scottish folk music. Um, and so the music consists of just literally having that top violin line with chord symbols written in. So from the age of 14, I was playing, having to make up an accompaniment, um, for the fiddle music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:52] Jen: Now, the style is fairly straightforward, but, but there's undoubtedly a feel to it. There's undoubtedly a, uh, a stylistic element, um, to it. that you need to grasp. But ultimately, you're having to just reach for chords out of chord symbols and make up an accompaniment. And so that degree of sort of keyboard harmony and facility with busking chords started really quite early for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:16] Jen: While also doing piano lessons and grades and scales and all the things that you need. By the age of 16, I was playing keyboards in a working men's club band. Um, where again, it's that having to conjure it out of nowhere. Um, I've told this story so many times, it's verbatim. God's truth, um, exactly how it happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:41] Jen: I set up my DX7. I would have been 16 years old. My mum had driven me to the gig. Um, and there's a drummer and there's a singer. And we're in a bowling club outside Kilmarnock. Um, and the singer turns to me and says, Do you know Blanket on the Ground? A pretty well known country band. song at the time. And I said, no, he said, it's in G.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:02] Jen: One, two, one, two, three. And that, I swear to God that happened. Um, now it was a little bowling club dance sort of thing. And there was the bingo and, and, and, you know, we were basically just a little trio playing in the corner of the room, but it was, you know, I got paid 50 quid for it. You know, it was a gig.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:20] Jen: Um, and, and that, it was a bit of a roast for me that night, but that's essentially how I, Is &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:26] Oren: it true that then at 17 you MD'd a panto? How do you get from 16 to 17 doing two very seemingly different things in terms of sort of skill &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:38] Jen: level I suppose? I think basically from, from the age of 14, 15, 16 I sort of had a bit of a growth spurt musically and I think it became fairly clear that I, I could hold my own in a piano and sort of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:54] Jen: So, so the, the Working Men's Club bands, um, the, the Panto was, was a direct spin off from that. Um, they, they desperately needed a keyboard player. It was four weeks of Panto. Um, we did Paisley Town Hall. Um, we did a place in Duntee, I can't remember where, and Aviemore, a cinema in, in Aviemore that had been converted into a theatre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:15] Jen: Um, I can't believe I remember all that stuff. Anyway. Um, uh, Funnily enough, there were one or two people in that who went on to have really quite remarkable, remarkable careers. Um, but the big interesting element, or the big box office draw, if you like, in inverted commas, was Andy Stewart. Um, he, of Donald Where's Your Truesor's fame and the Scottish soldier and all, you know, he was a really, really big Scottish folk, um, uh, performer and entertainer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:45] Jen: And, uh, he was playing Baron Hardup in Cinderella. Um, And, uh, the woman who was playing Cinderella was in, uh, Take the High Road, which was a Scottish soap at the time, and there I was, 17, took time off school, um, I had to go and speak to the headmaster to see if I could get off for four weeks to go and play keyboards in this band.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:06] Jen: And was that given freely? Yes. That's amazing. Um, I mean, I think they were a little bit reluctant. But there had already been arguments and fights because I wanted to go and do music and they didn't want me to because I was quite good at sciences and languages and things and quite academic. And, um, and I was going to give it all up and go and be a musician.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:25] Jen: And, um, they didn't fancy. Throw in my library. Throw in my library, exactly. Um, and, and they didn't fancy that much. Um, but, uh, But yeah, I go to, I mean it wasn't, it wasn't that much time off school because it was over Christmas. So it was maybe the last couple of weeks and then the two week period over, over the Christmas break or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:42] Jen: Um, but yes, I, I absolutely, um, had to ask off and went and toured, toured Scotland with this little, little Panto on my DX7. Um, for real, not making it up. Incredible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:55] Claire: So, so what happens, what takes you? beyond that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:59] Jen: Um, so that was sixth year at school. I auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music as it was then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:05] Jen: Um, the, the Scottish Run, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Uh, it's now the RCS Royal Conservator. Um, and I didn't get in, um, quite rightly, I was a hopeless classical piano player by this point. Um, I'd only been playing since. I just, I didn't even do beyond my grade six. So yes, there was absolutely, absolutely It beat me and I stopped at four.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:27] Jen: Did you? When I failed it. I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:31] Claire: did zero grades. And now my piano playing makes total sense to you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:35] Jen: The thing about being a piano player, of course, auditioning for somewhere like that, is everyone's Everyone's a piano player, so the competition's incredibly high. From a classical pianist perspective, I was dreadful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:46] Jen: But from a sort of busking, working men's club, folk band, pantomime, piano playing, piano player, um, perspective, I was, um, developing a particular set of skills, I think, which made me kind of, you know, I think that &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:04] Oren: sort of busking mentality and approach, does that make it easier then to approach playing musical theatre where you've got such a diverse range &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:14] Jen: of music?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:14] Jen: I think there's no question that it helped and it absolutely was instrumental in me actually getting to theatre in London. Um, uh, and that's the, the sort of, how did I, how did I really get here story, um, which, which is coming up in, you can put, you can put that in the trailer. Um, uh, so, so yeah, I, I didn't get into the academy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:38] Jen: Um, I auditioned for the university instead, uh, Glasgow University and did, um, music there. Um, where, In fact, I did an exam. Gosh, this is just coming back to me. I did an entrance exam for the university, which was much more academic and sort of, um, musical theory based, rather than just relying on the performance thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:01] Jen: At my interview after the exam, There had been an analysis of a piece that you only got to hear. You didn't see it written down. And you had to write certain things, and what happens at this point, and what happens at that point, and, you know, describe this and describe that. At the interview, they presumed that I had known the piece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:22] Jen: But I hadn't known the piece. I just had heard it. been able to answer the questions based on, I don't know, maybe it's the way my brain works or whatever, but that sort of musical ability, or whatever it is, that ability to analyze it, to hear the nuts and bolts, and hear the cogs turning, and basically what I believe I've built my entire career on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:43] Jen: My career on this, this ability, um, clearly was manifesting itself then already. So I spent five years at university in Glasgow with my middle year in Massachusetts, um, on an exchange, um, which was rather glorious. Loudon Calamity Jane. I ended up playing that, so that was my sort of first project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:05] Jen: experience, um, of actual musical theatre outside of Pantomime. I know Pantomime is musical theatre obviously, but, but, you know, uh, repertoire, uh, musical theatre. Um, that same group asked me back to conduct, uh, to be the MD of a production of Cabaret because their MD, who had MDed Calamity Jane, actually wanted to be in the show for, for a change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:29] Jen: And so, I ended up conducting a production of Cabaret, age 20. Um, which is kind of bizarre given what my current day job is. Um, and, uh, I should mention that the orchestra for Cabaret in this amateur dramatic production was led by, um, Nan Caldwell, or she was Nan White was her married name, who was, um, an aunt of mine who, um Um, played in the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Dr.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:01] Jen: Ian White, who was a great uncle of mine, who actually founded the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Um, now, that makes me sound like a nipple baby, but I never met him. Um, I never, he died long before I was, I was born. And, and I never had any association with, with that. I mean, there was a musical side to the family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:21] Jen: Um, And I knew Nan and her daughter Eileen growing up, and Eileen was very much a sort of busky piano player as well, and, you know, we had a certain affinity. Um, but bizarrely that sort of classical symphony orchestra gene thing clearly went, went away. past me, or maybe there's, maybe there's, there is some kind of element of the DNA, um, is in me, I don't know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:45] Jen: Yes, I sort of imagine there might have been this route where I'm, I get taken under, under a wing and, and I end up rising in that sort of, um, uh, environment, but no, that didn't happen. Um, I was so hopeless at classical music. Um, I think I've got better at it because I've sort of grown up as a musician, but back then I really was dreadful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:03] Jen: My piano lessons, my, um, I, uh, Isabel Anderson was my teacher and, um, I understand every single word she said to me now, but I didn't then. And, and she was tearing her hair out. And rightfully so, because, because I just couldn't translate what's written on the page back into music again. And now it's the thing I believe is my greatest skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:26] Jen: If I, I would never say anything that out loud, but it's a podcast, this is what you're supposed to do. You said it out loud and you're allowed to. I said it out loud. Um, but I couldn't do it until I was at least in my late twenties, if not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:39] Claire: And does that come back to the wanting to get it right &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:42] Jen: thing? Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:43] Jen: Yeah. Yes, um, but also, I don't know, I didn't, I can't, I can't describe the sort of, the emotional disassociation, disassociation or disassociation, um, with it, but, but I, I wasn't connected to myself yet emotionally, I think. I think I was sort of a very emotional late developer, um, and, um. I don't know, I'm projecting back then, I don't remember.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:11] Jen: But I just remember playing this, these bits of Chopin or Bach or whatever, or Beethoven, you know, as you do when you haven't got lessons, you know, from a classical degree. Um, uh, and, And simply, mechanically representing the notes on the piano. And not even that well. But there was nothing connected. But weirdly, and this is the bit I understand, as Bellandeson was trying to get me to realise, when I played something that I'd written, I did connect with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:41] Jen: So I could actually play something that felt like music and felt like it was emotional and felt like it was, it belonged. Um, but I couldn't. You know that thing that happens when, when you write a piece, you're, you're, you're, you're. Perhaps you don't. Some people do. You write a piece of music, you have to write it down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:58] Jen: And an awful lot of non reader musicians, non trained musicians hate this part because they hate the idea that it gets um, uh, sort of ossified when you, when you write it down because you have to make so many compromises to, to, to make it fit between the lines and the dots and, and the whatever. Um, you have to, you have to, you have to write it down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:18] Jen: Compromise it, squash it, um, um, Subdivide it, you know. Reduce it. Reduce it, yeah. Into essentially what is a recipe or a set of instructions. Um, it's like, it's like you've made soup and you desiccate it to make a cup of soup and you put it in a sashi and you've got to put the hot water back in and stir it again to make it into the, into the soup again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:42] Jen: Do you know what I mean? Um, and. I really like doing that now. Because that's the whole point of the interpretation of a piece of classical music, is remembering that you have to turn it back into the music again. Um, I even wrote a song about it. Uh, in my Underworld musical. No, I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:03] Claire: was just about to say, at what point do you start &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:06] Jen: composing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:07] Jen: Oh, um, gosh, no, I've been doing that since I wrote a piece, um, when I was 14. I wrote a piece for the school brass band at age 15 that was played at one of their concerts. I couldn't play very well back then, but I really understood how things were. So just from sitting in the middle of a brass band playing the baritone horn, I had, I had clearly registered all the little, the ways in which each of the sections of the band interacted and how you created an orchestration and the sort of broader textures of music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:38] Jen: So I wrote this piece. The melody was really, really simple. The chords were really, really simple. I made a huge mistake with the modulation into the minor key, because I went to the tonic minor, not the relative minor, um, but that's just because I didn't have that training yet. Um, but what I did have was, was the tuba's doing what the tuba's doing and the, the seconds and the tenor horns doing the offbeats, because sadly that's all they end up, end up doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:03] Jen: Um, the trombones at one point had a little counter melody, um, and, uh, you know, and just in terms of. Understanding the sort of orchestration and arranging nuts and bolts. So yeah, it was called A Little Bit of Fun and it was bloody awful. But, um, but it was played in a school concert. I guess I started noodling at the piano, um, quite early, I guess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:30] Jen: Because I really was like I don't mean, I need to be careful, not offend anyone, but I didn't enjoy piano lessons initially because I couldn't bear the dozen a day and the scales and the exercises that were just really, really dull. What I wanted was to play tunes. And this is a really, really common thing among musicians, I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:48] Jen: And the reason why a lot of musicians stop is because it's not very exciting. It's not very rock and roll. It's not very fun. As soon as I started playing with other people, like in the workmen's club band or in the, A real interest space society. Um, you start, um, the, the, the part that makes it feel like music, you know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:08] Jen: Um, uh, so I guess I didn't stick in at the classical piano stuff until I ended up going to university and I was doing a performance degree, so I kind of had to, and I kind of, I, I fudged my way through my, you know, performance recitals at the end of my fourth year and my fifth year. And, and I was a pretty hopeless classical piano player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:25] Jen: But, um. my, my facility with chords and harmonies and understanding how music works was, was developing. And, and I think that's what my degree's in. I did harmony, uh, to level four, which is quite, you know, for, for my bachelor's degree. Um, it was just me and Alan Smith in that class. Um, he's a very, very, very clever musician.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:48] Jen: Um, and um, Yeah, orchestration, analysis, just understanding how it all goes together. So I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:55] Claire: know you as an incredible storyteller through music, and somebody who, who will not let that suffer, ever, and will always support it with music. So when does that harmonic facility and the structural understanding and everything, when does that meet the storytelling?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:16] Jen: Gosh. Well here's the funny thing, is that the tunes that I was writing, I remember my first ever one called it Highland Dreams, I remember my mum showing it to a musician friend, there's no doubt that there was already a kind of trying to convey some kind of storytelling element in that. It was kind of mournful and kind of sentimental and, and, and clearly was conveying some kind of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:43] Jen: Yeah. musical storytelling even if it wasn't conscious for me at that point. And funnily enough, obviously, uh, you know this already, but my album, Stories, um, which I recorded in 2012, um, was called Stories because it's the most common thing. Now, I mean, people will say this to, you know, to everyone about music making, you think, you know, see things or see pictures or, or, or tell stories or what have you, but, um, it was just a, it was a common refrain and, and with regard to, you know, You know, people hearing, hearing my music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:15] Jen: And it didn't matter what the story was, even if it was different, and it says this in my album sleeve. Um, it doesn't matter if it's the same story as I'm hearing or seeing or, or imagined when I wrote it. As long as there's a story happening in your brain with the music and you're happy to listen to it, then that's, you know, that's, that's a result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:31] Jen: Um, so that's why the album's called Stories. But connecting that to the musical theatre thing, though, I think took a while. But clearly it was sort of innate. There was a sort of instinct for that. But it didn't help me through the classical piano because, my God, I can hear the storytelling in Rachmaninoff and Chopin and, and You know, you name it, and I lean towards the Russians these days, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Rimsky Korsakov, you know, absolutely obsessed with the sort of storytelling elements of those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:05] Jen: The Firebird is my all time favorite piece of music, I utterly, utterly adore it. And Shostakovich's Piano Concerto, the second, the first movement of the second Piano Concerto, I just love, again, the storytelling, you know, just innate storytelling. Um. I even borrowed a bit of, um, danse macabre for, um, the orchestrations of Cabaret, um, because of the storytelling in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:29] Jen: I didn't know that. Yes. Where? Yes. Tell me. Our production of Cabaret, um, Tom Scutt is the designer and Tom designed this, um, magnificent costume for Eddie Redmayne as he came out the stage. If any of you've seen the production of Cabaret, I know you have Claire. Um, uh, so, so the MC comes out the stage dressed as, as death or as a devil or a skeleton or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:58] Jen: It's sort of not particularly clear but it's a fabulous sort of skeleton y spooky costume and there's, there's and then he appears out of the very depth of hell. Um, and the intro to Money, which is the song he's about to sing. Money in the movie, um, is a sort of vaudevillian sort of comedy routine with, with coins down the pants and sort of, you know, whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:23] Jen: And so, for me, the arrangement of Money didn't quite carry enough storytelling to reflect this devilish figure, or death like figure, coming out of the stage. So, I felt I needed to augment with a little bit of arranging, a little bit of orchestration, the intro. to money, and indeed the the dance break in the middle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:46] Jen: The figure that I wrote for that it was was directly, it's not borrowed, it's not a quote but it was directly influenced by by the the opening um violin passage in Tosca Macabre. There you go, I'm owning up to it on &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:00] Oren: the podcast. No, I think it's fantastic. I mean in, in, in. Everywhere you look in, in such a creative space, people are always borrowing things and being inspired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:08] Oren: And I think it's just an incredible way to be inspired by something and put it into a new format. That's what, I didn't know that and I think it's wonderful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:17] Jen: Really cool. Um, it, it went even further because Tom had imagined this sort of, uh, Tarantella thing. He was, he was channeling a Tarantella, this sort of dance of death, this idea that you work yourself up into a frenzy and then, um, and die, dance and dance and dance until you die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:31] Jen: And so we even put in, uh, or I wrote this, um, violin sort of obligato solo for the, for the dance sequence in the middle, which again is, is not in the original orchestration, um, but it just, it's a sort of slightly rhapsodic kind of violin feature, um, while the devil character or, or death character is, is casting spells on these poor, hapless souls that He is, uh, um, you know, the one that capitalist, capitalism has ruined or whatever, whatever this story is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:05] Jen: Again, again, there, there's a, there's a story implied. I think I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:08] Oren: remember saying this to you, actually, after I'd seen Cabaret, that I came out and I, I remember saying it was the most immersive production I have ever seen in terms of you, you genuinely feel like you're there in that environment. Kind of, you know, the fly on the wall type thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:28] Oren: And yes, there's a big part because of the acting and stuff, but the, the, it's the music that just pulls you in and it holds you there and it keeps you in that story. And I think that was for me, the first time I had ever experienced something so gripping. And now I'm really happy to know some of the Ins and outs of why that's so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:51] Jen: Well, but there's another hugely significant element, and Nick Lidster, the sound designer, deserves all the credit in the world for this. But when you imagine that if you're sitting in a theatre that has a proscenium arch, and the speakers are arranged around the proscenium arch or above, or in some cases within the, within the set, in fact most cases nowadays within the set, you're still getting a, a, a sort of framed picture of it visually as well as orally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:26:18] Jen: You're still sitting outside it like listening to your stereo. The thing about the cabaret thing is that the speakers are all around you and so you're and the band of course are in the space with you um rather than hidden away or whatever. So, so you, you are in it. Do you know what I mean? Literally you're, you might as well be sitting in the pit and, but because that happens physically, you feel like you're in it and you're in the club and the dancers are performing behind you in some cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:26:47] Jen: What I love about that is that you then become complicit in what's going on with the story because you can't, you're not outside it anymore. You're not safe from it. And as things start to turn nasty and you realise that you think Ernst is just the greatest guy, isn't he great? He's so charming, so lovely, and then he turns out he's a Nazi and it's just, you can't escape, you can't run away, you know, you're stuck and you can't disassociate from it because well, it's just happening over there, you know, I love that aspect of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:18] Jen: I was about to tell a story earlier on about my, my, the lyric I wrote for that song, reduction of music into, into, into lines and dots and things, um, from my Underworld musical. Because before, um, uh, Cabaret happened, I had this idea of, of, uh, I'm not the first person to have this idea, but this particular musical I was writing, um, is set in a speakeasy, um, um, illicit jazz club in the twenties in Chicago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:50] Jen: Um, And the idea was going to be that it doesn't even have a performance space. It's just, it's just a club and the performance just happens around, around you. I loved the, the, the way you could blur the edges between audience and um, And so you just feel like you're inhabiting it, like the person next to you could be a performer, then maybe there's an empty seat and the performer comes and sits down, or, or, or maybe it's, you know, somebody who's been given a hat to wear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:16] Jen: Just, I, I, I, this idea you could, you could just give random audience members hats to, you know, to make them look like they were, you know. Part of it. And then you would further blur the edges. Anyway, I'm still quite excited about it. And Cabaret, this production of Cabaret, demonstrates just how incredibly effective it is at making you feel like you're not just watching a story, but actually part of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:39] Oren: Oh, absolutely. I really want to go back to Underworld though, because I listened to it and I think it is one of the most fantastic things I've listened to. I adore it, but I'm also a very big fan of sort of speakeasy. I, yeah, I want to know &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:51] Jen: more. I've been working on this project for such a long time. The thing is, for the first ten years, and it's been that long, the first ten years of me writing it, I didn't know what I was doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:03] Jen: I was so, I was not yet connected to the storytelling. And also I'd never read a book about writing or anything like that. And I fancied my chances of doing it myself. And I was so hopeless. Something happened, I don't know when or where or why. And pennies just started dropping in terms of, in terms of writing, in terms of connecting to stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:23] Jen: And so, and then I started reading books about writing and, and my lyrics started getting a bit better and my connection with, with the emotional side of the storytelling started getting better and then I started getting, um, good people to collaborate with and, and he presto'd that demo, um, which I think you're referring to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:39] Jen: Yeah, it's, it's some, some work that I'm very, very I'm proud of and very, very fond of. The problem is, and it's a major problem, and one that I support and agree with, but unfortunately puts me in an awkward position, which is that the idea that I could write 1920s speakeasy musical set in Chicago as a playwright, quite Scottish sort of person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:03] Jen: I mean, nobody, you know, I can't, I can't take that to, to the U. S. or to anywhere and have anyone take me seriously. What do I know about Chicago in the 20s? Um, but just, it suited my purposes because, um, it's a Orpheus story, um, and I wanted it to be set somewhere. Um, where I could play with the sort of underworld parallels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:23] Jen: Oh, then of course, um, Hadestown came along. Um, and it's, even though it's, it's dramatically different in terms of how it's been interpreted and, and, and the music different as well. Um, it's, it's sufficiently close that, um, when I, I won't mention any institutions, but when I took my musical to a particular place, um, the, the, the knee jerk reaction was, well, it's too similar to Hadestown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:48] Oren: I think that the, that how everything is played out and the storytelling within that and the way that the, the music and the lyrics flow into not just sung and spoken, I think it's absolutely fantastic. And I would, have loved to have seen it on a stage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:05] Jen: I would love to see it on a stage as well, I have to be honest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:07] Jen: But what's really interesting about that for me, and thank you by the way, that's a very, very kind thing to say. And, and I need to be careful as well because, um, I actually played the piano for the auditions for the production of Hadestown that was in, at the National, and met the musical supervisor. So, so I'm not making any value judgment here, I promise you, because as far as I'm concerned, and I believe this wholeheartedly, um, any piece of musical theatre that gets people to come to the theatre is legit as far as I'm concerned, um, whether it's a jukebox musical, whether it's, um, in the case of, of Hadestown, an album that has been, um, you know, a sort of concept album, um, that has been adapted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:48] Jen: The, the, the distinction I want to make though is, is in regards to the, the style of song composition. Essentially it's the, the, the, the song structures are, are, um, As you would expect from that kind of music, they're very repetitive refrains, um, and again, no value adjustment, but it's what makes them groovy, it's what makes them really cool, it's what makes them a really, really good fun night in the theatre if, you know, if that's the kind of music that pushes your buttons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:19] Jen: Um, but what it means is that there's not an awful lot of inherent storytelling, especially with a repeated refrain, because it can never go anywhere, there's a sort of static quality to the song structure. Um, And I kind of got slightly obsessed with and, and my taste veers towards this sort of more Sondheim y, post Rodgers and Hammerstein kind of, uh, songs that, that, that have a forward momentum, a lyric that can take you somewhere, that, that drops you off somewhere different to where you got on the, the, the bus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:53] Jen: Um, And so the very idea of repeated refrain or a chorus that returns unchanged is anathema to that because it can't, it can't take you anywhere dramatically. I mean, the best example is still one of my all time favorites from a very, very troubled musical, but the end of Act One of Carousel, the soliloquy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:19] Jen: It's an astonishing piece of musical storytelling in terms of all the chapters it goes through and the revelation. And it breaks my heart every single time because if it's played well, if this character, this troubled, damaged character has this realisation. Anyone who knows the piece will know what I'm talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:41] Jen: That's what interests me about musical theatre. The way music can bend to and adapt to and also lead you on those musical journeys, on those lyrical journeys, story journeys is what floats my boat and pushes my buttons. And it makes me slightly frustrated at the moment because there's been a huge swing towards, um, Uh, the, the, the.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:05] Jen: stop the play and sing a song and then start the play again and sing a song. Um, that, that returned to that sort of jukebox style or that, um, uh, pop music style, which, which worked really well for Irving Berlin and Cold Portraiture. I mean, it's not a bad thing. It's just, it's not my preferred, you know, preferred medium, preferred style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:28] Jen: Um, so with Underworld, um, I was very much trying to write, uh, a song. Songs that, although it's not through composed, there are scenes, but, but ultimately the songs do a lot of the heavy lifting dramatically. Whereas in the other style, um, the Hadestown style, the, um, well there are plenty of examples, um, Sunshine and Leith is an example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:52] Jen: I love Sunshine and Leith because I love the Proclaimers songs. But I do get frustrated in Act II when the songs just keep, the story keeps getting interrupted so we can sing a song for a while. And I much, much prefer if the story keeps going through the songs. So that's what I was trying to do with Underworld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:08] Jen: While also doing it in a jazz idiom because it's set predominantly in a jazz club. However, the Orpheus character, his name's Orville. because it's in Chicago in the 20s. Um, he's a classical musician, and so you've got this juxtaposition of classical music and jazz music, and then, and God's music and the devil's music, and let's sort of, and, and night and dark, and black and white, and you name it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:31] Jen: Um, sort of working on metaphorical levels is what I'm trying to achieve because I'm trying to do this underworld story, um, of, of Greek mythology while also, um, having a religious background. There's also the Orville's soon to be stepmother, not stepmother, god, what am I trying to say, mother in law, Agnes is, she leads the Temperance Society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:55] Jen: So she represents, in inverted commas, good, she's very religious, and of course Hades, Shadey, who runs this bar called Shadey's, which is the metaphor for Hades. It's not a metaphor, it's a Um, Um, is, you know, he represents the, the, the, the devil and, and alcoholism and, and, and having a good time. And Eunice, who's been brought up in this sort of religious, you know, street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:36:22] Jen: You know, cosseted and sort of scorched environment, um, is seduced, obviously, um, by Shady, um, and his speakeasy and his, and the jazz and whatever, because it's a much, much more fun place to be. Um, and so essentially, yes, it's just a, it's a underworld, Orpheus, legend, parallel thing going on. I love that you've listened to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:36:46] Jen: Thank you very, very much. Um, and just, just to. Finally get around that circle, um, uh, the character Sticks who's trying to teach Orville how to be, um, jazzy, um, that's the premise, but the reality is he's just trying to connect him with his emotional intelligence, um, uh, sings a song about, um, Orville's a classical musician, he's really square and he's really, um, emotionally repressed, have you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:14] Jen: Um, and he, he's getting a lesson from Styx and it's not going well. And he says, Oh, for heaven's sake, you know, it's because he's trying to learn jazz. And, and he says to Styx, uh, isn't there a book I can read for it? You know, do you have the sheet music for it? And, and, uh, Styx says, um, It ain't in a book, it ain't on a sheet, nowhere you can look for a hook that cooks, or a beat so sweet that you can't keep your seat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:43] Jen: That sound ain't found, notated and bound, enshrined, confined by dots and lines. It ain't the white notes or the blacks, the fact is jazz is in the cracks. And that to me is what I struggled with. Um, in my early 20s going to, and teens, going to piano lessons, um, the dots and lines, the confinement, the, the, the ossification of, of the music that had come out of these people, Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky, you name it, had to be written down in some fashion and it was the bit that I couldn't do which was making it back into music again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:19] Jen: Um, and that's, a lot of jazz musicians or, or non reader musicians have that attitude to music, somehow making it. Um, square, um, and mechanical. But the key thing is to reconstitute it, you know, in the performance. Um, it's, it's, it's just a, it's a mechanism. It's just a means to, to communicate it, you know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:44] Jen: But you still have to be able to do that bit. And there are an awful, awful lot of musicians who can't. And I was one of them for a very, very long time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:51] Claire: I have a question, which is something that comes up a lot with. Many of my performers, and I think might be relevant to your story because it's about belonging in a style and feeling connected to a style of music but not connected to another and it sounds like you had a little bit of that journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:12] Claire: How you can feel authentic in, and like, you know, you deserve to be there in a space that you don't necessarily feel that comfortable with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:24] Jen: That's hilarious because, because I don't. I feel, this is, this is the awful thing about being a sort of multi style kind of player in musical theatre is that I, I quite genuinely believe that I'm not, Eh, good at any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:38] Jen: I just have enough of the nuts and bolts and, and a lot of musician friends. Uh, in fact, uh, dear friend Paul, uh, Saunders, Clarine LER asked me to write, uh, a couple of pieces of music. He, pieces of music, he's a, a woodwind player. Um, and, and he, uh, teaches woodwind, reers, you know, flip player, cla night player saxophone players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:57] Jen: He basically collected, um, a bunch of, um. tunes, wrote most of them himself, but asked some other friends to write some, that covered all the bases that you might encounter in musical theatre, because you can't be a woodwind tribbler with a saxophone and a flute and a clarinet without being able to do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:18] Jen: One minute being Anything Goes, um, the next minute being Cabaret, and then, then being Next Norm, or, no, Next Norm doesn't have a woodwind player, but what am I getting at? Les Mis, you know, Phantom of the Opera, you name it. A lot of theatre musicians need to have those And I believe it's a huge part of my armory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:35] Jen: I believe I have the facility to do that because of all these different things that I did. My classical degree while also doing the Working Men's Club and I played in jazz bands. And I did jazz in my year in Massachusetts. I took jazz classes. Um, and so I feel I've got a sort of grounding in all of these things to be able to fake it essentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:57] Jen: Notes won't do it for you, it's how you interpret them, how you add in the, the scoops and squeaks and, and, and the things that, that make something sound like the thing you're trying to recreate. Because unless you know what that thing is, unless you, you've heard it and you're familiar with it, then you're never going to be able to do that because there's no way of writing it down on the page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:15] Jen: In terms of being able to authentically recreate something, um, that's out with you, the only way is to, you can't unless you've heard it, do you know what I mean? Because that was the other thing about me when I was a lot younger as a musician, you know, I wasn't a good jazz player because I didn't listen to any.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:33] Jen: I wasn't a good, um, classical player because I didn't listen to enough. Um, I spent all my time, all my free time doing working men's clubs and folk dances. You know, I played more Cayleys, um, you know, behind the piano than I know how to do. And country and western songs in, in, in, you know, working men's clubs and football clubs and bowling clubs, golf club dances and, you know, and the odd wedding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:58] Claire: How do you sit in that though? Are you comfortable with knowing enough and have you. Is that a journey you've taken to become &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:05] Jen: comfortable? Yes, until I'm in the vicinity of somebody who really knows how to do it. Like, if you put me next to a jazz player, then I will just shut my mouth and just sit and respectfully listen and learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:19] Jen: And it's the same with a classical musician, I will just go, you know what I mean? I'm acutely aware of how not good at any of these things I am. Um, but. From a musical theatre perspective, I'm good enough to be able to make it sound like I kind of know what I'm doing, I think. Um, and, and I've had that conversation with a number of musicians that I work with because, you know, though we, we all have our, um, individual strengths, um, uh, and some that we're particularly good at, we all have sufficient grounding and sufficient capacity to, um, to, to fake it, essentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:56] Jen: That's what we're doing. So, I mean, there's an inherent musical ability in that to be able to, you know, rely on, you know, reach into and to, um, but, um, but no, I wouldn't pretend to be, um, an expert in any of them. I'm &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:11] Oren: going to list some things off and I'm going to ask you a follow up question from that because I think this is very interesting what you've just said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:16] Oren: So you've worked on Les Mis, Avenue Q, Sunset Boulevard, Phantom, Parade, Cabaret, and then the films of Les Mis, Phantom, and you've done. Some work on x factor. From everything that we've discussed today, you are, you seem to be a very capable, multifaceted, not just musician, but person, with a very diverse range of skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:41] Oren: And I have a quote here from another interview that you did that says, I'm absolutely crippled by imposter syndrome. And I would love to dive into that, because everything that you've kind of explored today, from the outside, I don't get that. I don't see you as this person, as this imposter, but I'm really curious from your perspective to understand how you see &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:03] Jen: that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:04] Jen: The weird thing about being a musical director now is with budgets getting ever smaller and people not understanding what musicians do, and also not wanting to pay for musicians. Oh my god, bands are getting small and, and, and budgets for orchestration, but for copying, you know, because, and also as, as the technology has advanced, it's been possible to offer all these things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:27] Jen: So, for example, as an MD, used to be all you would want to be able to do is probably play the piano, probably conduct a bit, and probably know your way around a score, you know, and maybe if you know a wee bit about how the music relates to the storytelling that's a, you know, an advantage, but there are plenty of MDs who don't know that and just interpret it musically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:48] Jen: Um, um, but on several productions now I have not only I mean, let's leave the composition aside. I have written the music, but, but, but on most of them I've done some degree of orchestration, um, some degree of copying. So that's Sibelius for me on my laptop or my desktop. Um, uh, I'm a composer. Avid Sebelius user.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:14] Jen: That's funny. 'cause Avid now owns Bilion . Yes. I'm, I'm an avid, avid Sebelius user. That's a niche joke. Um, um, somebody's gonna get it. Yeah, absolutely. Somebody So, so, yes. Um. Arranger, orchestrator, copyist, um, you know, note, Sibelius user. For La Cage aux Folles, which I've just done, and for Cabaret, I programmed the Pro Tools tempo maps for the click tracks that we used, because I do a lot of Pro Tools stuff, and I do a lot of demos of my compositions, whether it's orchestral compositions or, um, or, or stuff that I've, uh, written for something that people need to hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:54] Jen: Um, I do that on Pro Tools, so I, so I know Pro Tools a bit and I've got a lot of sample libraries that I've, I've collected over the years. So I do a bit of sampling. Um, uh, I am a conductor, I'm a pianist, um, There, there are others. Um, I'm, I'm, I'm not a vocal coach, as Claire will attest, but it's a huge part of, of, of the, of the job as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:17] Jen: Um, and also I know a wee bit about sound because, you know, I, I have, I had a studio, I, I have a studio ish at home, um, with a collection of microphones and cables and, and, and you name it. Um, but I am not an expert at any of those things. I, I literally have, they're all, I'm self taught in all of them except for the, the musical piano playing stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:40] Jen: We're obviously eye teachers, but, but the proto stuff, the Sibelius stuff, the, um, sound stuff, the recording, um, everything I'm, I'm fudging. And, and I would be instantly shown up if I was in a room with somebody who genuinely knows what they're doing with any of these things. Because, you know, there are Sibelius.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:00] Jen: experts. There are Pro Tools experts that, um, and, and I've, my, the gaps in my knowledge are laughably huge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:09] Oren: I, I, I mean, I, I have the same experience. I, I wouldn't classify myself really as an expert in any one particular thing, but I know many, many things. I can program, I can, you know, compose a little bit, I can play the piano a little bit, vocal coach, whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:25] Oren: I guess I'm, I'm sort of okay with that. Because actually I think it makes my output better and I would argue in your case It also makes your output better the work that you create and the creativity you have as a result of knowing lots of really technical things and really complex things Makes what you're creating better than one person that knows absolutely in depth everything about a piece of software but then ultimately doesn't know how to go and utilize that in You In a creative space or in a production space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:00] Oren: So I think, I don't know, I think from my perspective, imposter syndrome is sort of not what people think, but also I understand why people think the &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:12] Jen: way it is. I think to be a musical director in musical theatre, knowing a little bit, given that it is such a major collaborative. industry with all of these different aspects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:23] Jen: You know, Nick Lidster and I, he's the sound designer of Cabaret, and La Casual Fall, we're able to talk about certain things at a certain level because I know a little bit about sound. Um, same with, with the proto stuff. Um, and, uh, Jason Carr revisited his orchestrations for La Casual Fall and, and I offered a couple of little, tiny little nuggets in the orchestration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:45] Jen: Uh, Cabaret, I did some orchestra, some extra orchestrations. Um, so I'm able to talk. You know, on a certain level with an orchestrator, but somebody like, um, Simon Hale, um, astonishing, astonishing orchestrator, um, there are, there are countless, countless more talented people than me is what I'm getting at. Um, and, and yes, I cannot go into a room and say, I'm good at this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:12] Jen: Because I don't believe I am, because I know, and I swear to God, this is where the imposter syndrome thing came from, and I still believe this. When I was writing music in my teens, it was bad. I mean, it was so naive, so incredibly naive. But I would never play any of it. And do you know, the reason I don't play, the reason I, I haven't sent Underworld to enough people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:35] Jen: I haven't shown it to enough people. Or The Famished Land, or any of the other pieces I've done. Because, as long as Stravinsky existed, or John Williams, I used to say John Williams. You know, it's like, why am I trying to write film music from John Williams, or Thomas Newman, or, you know, Michael Giacchino, or whoever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:57] Jen: You know, people who I admire exist. I sort of, I sort of just believe myself to be. not as good as them, and so I kind of, I kind of go, why? I think there's a couple of things &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:50:10] Claire: in there that, I mean I think this is something that so many of the artists that I work with experience, this, why, why would I go there if that person can sing this that much better?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:50:22] Claire: And I think, well immediately, because my whole life is filled with Hamilton quotes, immediately I have a Hamilton quote for you, which is, The world is wide enough for you and Stravinsky. Absolutely. Um, but secondly, and it's coming back to what you're suggesting, Oren, that there is, and it has taken me most of my professional life to realise this, Your power, your strength and your unique skills lie in the power of other, in, in the power of the fact that it is the very mix of skills that you have in the ratio that you have them in that makes you uniquely you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:03] Claire: And that is right for the environment you walk into. That is what you bring for the environment you walk into. And, and that's right for, you know, my, my collection of skills is right for most of the people I meet, but not all of them. And that's okay. You know, we're not right for every situation. You're absolutely right for the cabaret situation because you've absolutely been a key part of the creation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:32] Claire: Yeah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:33] Jen: Yeah, yeah, I, I think I got lucky with that one. And I think it has, it has yielded results in terms of what's happened in the, in the year and a bit since. Um, in terms of the phone ringing and the emails arriving. Um, but can I tell you, as evidence of my imposter syndrome, the fact that you said there's room for me and Stravinsky, I think I will, I will worry about that and I will not sleep tonight because that is going to go on a podcast and some, and my name, I'm going to sound so presumptuous that my name should be in the same paragraph as Stravinsky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:08] Jen: You're the &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:09] Claire: only one assuming that we have to put the two things side by side. Why do we have to put them side by side? I mean, I put &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:17] Jen: them in that phrase. Alright. Yes. You put them in the phrase just, it's, it's . I, I swear to God I got a shiver. 'cause it like God, how I wanna swear. How presumptuous, how do you know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:27] Jen: Arrogant. Do you know? Once upon a &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:29] Oren: time , you might feel exactly the same thing. I was just gonna say that, and I think this, so this I, you know, I didn't really articulate it well before. Um, but I think this is like everybody is. Everybody suffers to some degree, I think, with imposter syndrome. But, you know, I'm such a hypocrite because I fully do as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:49] Oren: But then when I look at somebody else that is suffering from imposter syndrome, and I look at all of the skills that they have and all of the things that they've achieved, and all of the amazing things that they're doing, I'm just looking at that and I'm like, How do you not realise how amazing you are?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:06] Oren: How do you not realise that you are perfectly situated in Exactly, as you said, exactly where you need to be because you have the exact right recipe, ratio of skills for that. And I think you, I mean, you articulate it fantastically, but it's, yeah, but I'm such a hypocrite because I do it to myself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:24] Jen: But what if I told you that's not where I'd rather be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:29] Jen: Well, you want to be a pilot? No, I don't. Yes. Yes. No, I want my composing to be earning me enough money that I could have taken some, you know, pilot. lessons and, uh, flying lessons and, and, and bought my own plane. But, um, you know, I, I, I wanted to be writing film scores. And, um, and I would have needed to, perhaps if I'd found this emotional intelligence that I, I seem to think I have, or this connection that I, I'm pretending that I have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:01] Jen: Earlier I might have been able to push harder for that, but I think I'm definitely better at it now. Which kind of is what happens, you grow up essentially, you develop all these things. But no, I wanted to be writing music for films and still do. And the musical theatre thing came along and I started earning money quite early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:20] Jen: and started doing quite well out of that. And, and I got stuck. Because what I would have had to do is get rid of the money and the growing career and go and make the tea in the corner of a studio or become an assistant to somebody. But I was having fun doing musical theatre stuff and conducting. I mean, I conducted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:44] Jen: Do you know, it's funny, we've skipped on from the how did I get to be here? I haven't even told my story about getting to, getting to London. Just, just turned 26. Um, which is, which is not young nowadays. I mean, because there are people arriving in the West End conducting at 21, 22, because they've been in such and such a musical theatre course and whatever, you know, but back then I was coming from Scotland, where I'd been trying to work in Scotland for a while, um, post university, and then Find my way to London, um, which is my big origin story, although it's funny because that was the, that event was the, the trigger, the, the sort of the, the once in a lifetime event that resulted in it, but weirdly it was all the things that I had worked to, you know, it was all the sort of composite elements that made me the person that was of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:32] Jen: Um, I'd better explain. So, um, I'm probably in my early 20s, um, mid 20s, yeah, early 20s, 22, 23, just out of university. Um, and I've got this background in, in playing folk music, this background in working with clubs, background in theatre and pantomime, etc. Um, it means I can play from chord charts, I can, um, improvise, um, accompaniments in, in a variety of different styles already by this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:00] Jen: Um, and also I've been listening to musical theatre. because, um, I was just interested in it. My, my, we had musical theatre stuff on in the house. My mum and dad had taken me to theatre shows since I was, you know, knee high. Um, so there was an interest in theatre. So I, I had a huge breadth of musical experience by the time I, I got out at the other end of university and I'd started working in musical theatre in Scotland, um, albeit a smaller scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:28] Jen: And, um, a fabulous, uh, Glasgow piano player called Hil, Hilary Blu, Brooks. Hilary Brooks, um, uh, had double booked herself. She was supposed to be playing for auditions for the Cameron McIntosh organisation in Glasgow and had double booked herself and she asked me to see if I could go and play for these auditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:49] Jen: Um, and it was at a time, this was the early 90s, um, Cameron's office still did regional open auditions to find casts for Phantom and Les Mis, which were their two biggies at the time, obviously. And so I turn up, very, very green, very, very naive, but I'm sat behind the piano, and Trevor Jackson was there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:14] Jen: This is, what, 30 years ago nearly? And the key thing, it was open edition, so there's like 300 people queued around the block. Um, and these people are from every walk of life. Um, and they've just, we, I mean, there's some amazing stories of people who just joined the queue and turned up and, and said, you know, what are you going to sing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:33] Jen: Oh, I don't know. Um, you know, because they didn't know what they were there for, but, you know, yeah. Um, there's some, there's some great stories. Fantastic stories. We had a guy, I swear to God, sang Walking in the Air. He was, he had tattoos and he had a vest top on and he sang Walking in the Air at, you know, the Boy Soprano pitch because it was the only song he could think of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:51] Jen: So I accompanied it because I was, you know, accustomed to busking and what have you. So, so I didn't think anything of it apart from the fact I did a perfectly lovely day playing the piano and I seemed to be getting on all right with, with these people. Turns out that the night before, the day before they'd been in Manchester and they'd had somebody from the RNCM in Manchester, who was a classical pianist, who was completely out of their depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:14] Jen: Now I'm sure they were technically magnificent but they didn't know the repertoire, they couldn't play from chord charts, they couldn't busk, they couldn't play poppy stuff or country stuff or whatever. I, I had that because of this peculiar upbringing I'd had. I just had fingers in all of these pies, albeit non experts in any of them, but, but enough, you know, know how to be able to kind of, you know, make it up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:39] Jen: So I did that day, um, and then went back home to Scotland. Um, the following year, maybe two years later, I get a call to do it again, but this time they want me to come to all of the venues, because they don't want to pick up a pianist in each venue, because They'd had bad experiences, so they asked me if I'd done them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:59] Jen: And I, this time, just said to Trevor Jackson, is there anyone you can introduce me to in London? I'd really like to come down. And he did. Um, introduced me to, um, Sylvia Addison and Maurice Cambridge, who were two of the most prominent, um, Um, and to a certain extent still are. Um, and um, I got an interview and auditioned for Showboat at the Prince Edward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:59:23] Jen: Uh, and ended up third keyboard player and second assistant musical director. And I actually conducted it. Um, so I came down to London, this is 98. Um, it was in May and I conducted the show in August. It was the only one time I did it before it came off because it was only the emergency conductor, the second assistant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:59:40] Jen: But I. Um, and that's how I translated all of that weird bizarre upbringing into actually getting down to down to London and then things just spiralled from there. And what's really funny about, we're here on Carlyle Street off Dean Street and I had a cup of coffee at Café Nero opposite the stage door of the Prince Edward, which is where I did my first ever London job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:00:08] Jen: So it was kind of funny coming here to talk about this and actually being in the room where it happened, or the place where it happened. We have two questions for you. Yes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:00:20] Claire: We don't know what one of them is. Yes. Okay, so question one is, the show is called Five Minute Call. Can we ask you, what do you do at the Five &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:00:28] Jen: Minute Call?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:00:29] Jen: At the Five Minute Call, invariably, I am struggling to get into my costume, stroke, suit, stroke, whatever I'm doing. Um, and makeup. The only time I wear makeup is when I'm performing. Um, because I spent too long going around the rooms to see the company, or, um, at a last minute rehearsal, or, um, I'm invariably late, um, because I haven't left enough time to get ready because of the stuff that MDs need to do before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:01:09] Jen: before they go on. Uh, checking, checking that the, the, uh, I mean on cabaret, for example, checking that the depths, um, are right. Checking that we've got the right keys on the stand, because we, we did a, the understudies had different keys. Um, things like that. So every &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:01:24] Oren: guest, writes a question for the next guest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:01:29] Oren: That's terrifying. I'm really excited as to what this is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:01:32] Claire: Oh, if you had to, underlined had, what one thing would you get rid of in the industry? And they've added three kisses just to sweeten &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:01:40] Jen: the If I had to What one thing would I get rid of in the industry? Are we talking musical theatre? Okay, no, here's, here's, There are layers to this answer, or at least there are deeper hidden layers in this answer, but what I would get rid of, um, what I struggle with regularly is this snobbery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:02:07] Jen: with regard to musical theatre from other forms of theatre, other forms of music, other forms of art. Um, and the, the, one of the layers to that is because sometimes musical theatre deserves it. Because we don't serve ourselves terribly well by not hiring people who know what they're doing in certain areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:02:28] Jen: Um, whether that's composers, songwriters, lyricists, actors. We constantly hamstring ourselves. Um, people look down their noses at musical theatre and say, Oh, it's a bit empty or it's a bit this or, or, you know, the acting's not very good or whatever. And it's because very often it isn't. How can we expect to take musical theatre seriously if we're going to cast?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:02:48] Jen: you know, people that are just going to put bums in seats. Now, I understand bums in seats, I understand producing, I understand money, I understand all of that. Um, I understand it acutely, um, given the work I'm doing just now. Um, but I would, yes, so broadly, uh, I, I wish to get rid of the snobbery, but I also wish to get rid of the stuff that is constantly undercutting as an art form because musical theatre at its best, um, is sublime and is life changing and I've been incredibly lucky to work on some astonishing productions, um, recently that have genuinely made a difference, um, and changed people's views and thoughts and, and, um, and, and demonstrate the power, uh, the transcendent power of, of music and drama together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:03:38] Jen: Thank &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:03:39] Claire: you so much for &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:03:40] Jen: coming, sharing your story. Thank you for having me. And sorry, it didn't make an awful lot of sense. No, it did. It made so &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:03:46] Claire: much sense. Absolutely did. And it's so wonderful for us all to hear each other's stories. Certainly, I am very passionate about this idea of the power of other and what we all bring to the industry that makes it as special as it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:03:59] Claire: So thank you for sharing your story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:04:00] Oren: There's absolutely people out there that are going to listen to this and go, I experienced this, I experienced these problems, I'm, I'm in this mindset or I'm in this, this situation. And I think what you shared today is so valuable to people. So genuinely, genuinely, thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[01:04:17] Oren: Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Episode Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:00] Oren: Hello and welcome to The 5 Minute Call. This is a podcast where we take a deep dive into the stories of the people that make theatre happen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:08] Claire: Today we are chatting to Chris Manuel. Chris has an amazing career spanning over two decades in the theatre industry. He's appeared in shows such as Starlight Express, Billy &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:18] Oren: Elliot, Matilda the Musical, Phantom of the Opera, Mary Poppins and Phantom of the Opera, again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:25] Oren: I mean, a fantastic way to start. Are you, have you always been an airhead? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:29] Kris: No, I've always been an utter airhead. Complete airhead. Um, and in my own little world, but in some ways I think that's kind of helped along the way. You know what I mean? So used to going into my own little head, and I suppose like a bit of a safe space if you like, and I think happy thoughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:49] Kris: No, I do, I do think that like it's a bit of a superpower in a way. Being able to just retreat into your own head and get away from all of the shit, and then come back out feeling like you've had a bit of a break. Was, did &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:02] Claire: performing give you that opportunity straight away? Or did something else do that stuff?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:09] Kris: I mean, I suppose like a lot of, a lot of kids going into musical theatre were, I don't want to say were oddbods, I think it's a bit more accepted now, but when I first found musical theatre, um, it was, again it was a bit of an escape because I was quite, it a bullied child and, um, I had a very few. In a circle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:30] Kris: I only had about three friends, um, and then I found this drama group and they were doing, um, I think it was 15 and they were doing every, um, Joseph. They were doing Joseph and, um, I always used to sing, but I was so bad and, um, and I got the part of Joseph so I couldn't have been that bad. Um, and I got Joseph and then that was kind of how it, how I got into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:58] Kris: And then, um. My first ever singing teacher, Flora Wilson, she taught my mum and my mum used to sing as well. And, um, she was great friends with my great grand who was a concert pianist. So that was all in that performing and that was in the family, but I had never thought about doing it until, until I started doing, um, And then it just kind of rolled from there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:02:25] Kris: I started to have singing lessons with Flora and, um, and then it just kind of, it went from there. I did that. And then I did Dracula Spectacular. And then I did High Society at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle. And then I did Judas in Jesus, in Jesus Christ Superstar. And then after that, that was when I was like, I think I want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:02:46] Kris: I had started to buy the stage newspaper because back in the day, you could buy a physical copy. And it had like auditions in the back. And, um, I used to read it. I was such a geek. I'd read it cover to cover to cover. And I'd go to the back and I would look at auditions and there was things like, if you want to be a pop star, call this number and sing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:03:03] Kris: Um. And I would do stupid things like that. I'd go to the phone box and I'd phone and I'd sing down, I have a really bad voice. But I used to sing down, like in the phone box, down to these little things. These, um, search for a pop star. And then, as I, I, I was, as I was turning, I found schools. And there was a one, um, called Mad College.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:03:23] Kris: Um, and it, um, and it was, um, Their, their slogan back in the day was we're mad for success. And I was like, and I, and there was something about it that I was like, Oh, I quite like, quite like that. And, and I auditioned. And I got, By this time I'd had singing lessons for a few years, um, and I was a gymnast, so I kind of took to dance quite easily, and I, I'm going off on a bit of a tangent, um, so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:03:51] Kris: Had you, had you done any I hadn't done any, no, I hadn't done any dance, I'd only done singing and acting, but I was a gymnast. Wow. And then, um, when I got my audition through for, for college, they were like, okay, you have to have prepared. A couple of dances and some songs and a couple of acting pieces. And so, there was a, a school in Newcastle called, then, uh, it's still there, Newcastle Dance Centre, and a girl, um, called Hayley, who was Anton Dex, she's still there, we're friends, um, she choreographed my, Anton Dex was Anton Dex's choreographer, and she choreographed my pieces, and, um, and yeah, and I went and I got in, and then, um, I, I got a full grant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:34] Kris: to go from the government. So I didn't, I didn't have to raise any money. It was, like, it was such a gift. And, back then, the, it was quite a small college but a lot of the, um, a lot of the, the teachers were, Pat Dennison, who was the artistic coordinator for Cats. We had Paul Domingue. He was um, The, he's choreographed for Steps and Five and Whitney Houston and like loads of people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:59] Kris: So these were the caliber of people that they had in, but it was smaller, smaller groups. So for me, who hadn't really done any dance, it was a place that I could really kind of turn the obsessive side of my personality onto what I was learning, because I only had three years there and I hadn't done any dance before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:17] Kris: So it was, you know, It was perfect. I think that if I had gone to a bigger college back then, like the Lanes or the Italia Conti, I, I might well have got swallowed up and not been as developed after three years as I was, having gone to a smaller college with the same tutors. Um, Yeah, I mean, I owe everything to, to, uh, Francis Clayton and, and MAD College because without them, I would never have then gone on and had a career, which then subsequently I went and retrained at the Royal Academy of Music when I was 34.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:52] Kris: And then, um, and then that is what helped me bridge moving from being, uh, primarily a dancer and a singer to being an, a singer and an actor and who could, who could still move. So if I hadn't gone to MAD College, uh, I would, I wouldn't have. I wouldn't have done anything. So, it was quite a &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:14] Claire: You mentioned going to the academy there and I know you've just recently been In their honours list, become an associate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:21] Kris: Last year, it was last year. Amazing, congratulations. Thank you &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:23] Claire: very much. Um, how was it going back to education at that point? Was that a scary thing to do? Um, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:31] Kris: not really. Um, a lot of people said to me it's a really brave thing to do. It was, you're really brave to do that. I was like, well, hunger for learning isn't brave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:41] Kris: That's just part of my personality. And like, now I'm 46, I know I don't look it. Yes, um, just a lot of work. One of the two. Um, no, joking aside. Um, I don't think that when you, when you want to learn, that has, that bravery has anything to do with it. That didn't even enter my head. It didn't. And when someone said, I was, said to me, Oh God, you're so brave going back to college.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:09] Kris: It made me go, Oh, is there, is there something I should be nervous about? But actually it, it, it was a joy. And, um, if I had the opportunity to go back and retrain again, at the age that I am now, I would, I would jump at the chance. It's just so bloody expensive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:24] Claire: Yeah. Well, you are still learning &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:28] Kris: now, aren't you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:29] Kris: Oh, absolutely, yes. I am &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:30] Claire: still learning. You've never, in all the time I've known you, you never, you never don't have some form of advancement and learning on the &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:39] Kris: go. Yeah, I mean, surely that's what it's all about. And I remember seeing some, I remember seeing something, um, years ago, um, and it was, I can't remember who it was, but it was a famous actor, and they had said, As soon as you think you know everything, that's when you stop and do something else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:56] Kris: And I just think there's so much to, there's so much to learn with regards to performance and finding honesty in the moment and find, and, and, and like our voices are such living, breathing things that, you know, you can wake up one day and like, we've talked about having 100 percent voice on a Thursday, but then you go out, you're a hundred percent on a Friday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:15] Kris: If you've been out the night before, isn't the same as what it was would be on a Thursday. So. And I just love learning how to manage that and to challenge myself. I think, I mean, I've got such an overactive, like, I'm always thinking so far ahead. And if I'm not interested, then I just don't give anything, I don't give anything to what, to what I do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:45] Kris: So. But there's so much to learn. Like, I mean you look at, especially in America, um, I, I go to, uh, a guy called Stephen Buchwald. And he does a lot of Meisner classes and acting, uh, scene study classes. And, Here, the way he talks about how people work in America is that people in America are pretty much the same as what I've just said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:09] Kris: They still have their singing lessons. They still go to their acting classes. They still go to, um, scene study class, or they still go to improvisation classes. People who are, like, Hollywood leading actors. They still go to class and they still have their demons the same as what we do. I mean, I have my demons, but as like, as soon as an audition comes in, I go, Oh, well, am I right for it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:30] Kris: Or my voice isn't quite right. Or my voice isn't in a, in a good place and I'm going to sound dreadful. And should I really, but then you, you, you deal with that and then you, you put the work in and then, um, sometimes it takes a little bit longer than you think to get a job, but. If you're constantly learning and you're constantly getting better, surely at some point, something's gonna happen, where you've then, you've broken through and you've made that transition to being somebody who wants to be part of the business, and somebody who is an integral member of a company, you know, like an ensemble member, the ensemble is like the heart of every, of every show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:08] Kris: And, um, I think there's a lot of focus on being a lead. And, you know, I've been very lucky. I've, I've played leads I've done, but I've also been as part of an, of an ensemble. And I think it's really important that the ensemble Uh, recognized as being the heart, the heartbeat of the company because without the ensemble, a lot of the shows on the West End would be absolutely nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:33] Kris: So, and I remember back in, when was it? It was when Jerry Spring of the Opera won Best Supporting Actor for the Ensemble. And I think it might have been around about 2005, after maybe, at the Olivier's. Maybe, And they weren't the ensemble one best supporting actor. And I just thought that that was such a huge move forward for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:00] Kris: on people who work in the ensemble because there are people who move from show to show to show as an ensemble in an ensemble capacity and that's what they love to do and I think to, to, to have moved into a, a time when&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:14] Kris: things like that and understudies are being celebrated is, is wonderful because there's a lot of hard work goes into being an ensemble member and being an, an individual within a choral or an ensemble capacity and also to learning huge roles. I mean I've understudied some huge roles and I end up, the work that goes into it and then to keep that fresh when you might not be on for three or four months and then bang you get a phone call and you're on and you have to get it into your body&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:51] Kris: as if it, as if you've done it, as if you've just finished your rehearsal period and the dealing with the pressure, um, is a huge thing and I just think it's wonderful that things like that are now being recognized and acknowledged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:05] Claire: Was your first gig an ensemble gig? What happens after &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:10] Kris: Mad? My first, I mean I did, I was in a Steps tribute band.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:14] Claire: Yes, we wanted to ask about &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:16] Oren: that! Right, so Claire sent this to me. She was like, we need, I was like, I need to know. Everything about this. So &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:23] Kris: when I was in my third year, I, I was, I was amazing. I loved it. I mean, back then, 50 quid a gig. It was like, and like, and I think we were, we were out. We were out about 28 nights a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:34] Kris: So if you think something like 1400 quid for a student who is getting his rent paid by his parents 1400 quid a month pocket money. I was like, ka ching! It was brilliant. Um, but like, it was so good. And. We had the full costumes, the full mics, we thought we sang live, um, it was all choreographed, and yeah, we just get in a van and go &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:59] Claire: and How did it come about?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:01] Claire: Did a group of you get &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:02] Kris: together and go? No, it was, there was an audition. There was an audition in the stage and it was by a company called Dance Attack, um, from Nottingham with some of my college friends and we all got the job, so it was brilliant. We'd finish college at five o'clock, get in a car, drive to Norwich or Ipswich or somewhere and sing and do a gig and get fed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:26] Kris: And then we'd be back home for one in the morning and then have to get up and go to college. It was, it was amazing. It was so much fun. And of course I was Faye. No. Yeah, what's quite ironic is I mean, I was H and, um, I actually didn't know that the Royal Academy did, A course until I saw on TV H Site Story where it was, did you never see it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:53] Kris: So H went to, or Ian went to the Royal Academy and they did a year following him around the Royal Academy and um, and I watched it and I was just like, and I'd always wanted to go to the Royal Academy but I didn't know that there was a musical theatre course there because Flora, my singing teacher, she um, had LREM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:14] Kris: after her name. Um, and I was like, Oh, I'd love to go there. And I always, from being a kid, I'd wanted, I'd wanted to go there. So I think along, somewhere along the way I had kind of cosmic ordered it. I watched this and then I found out that that's how I found out about the musical theater course and that it was a postgraduate diploma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:32] Kris: So I, I, I, I, I qualified. I remember it was the way that I got in was really funny. Not as in haha, but quite, quite funny. I was rehearsing for Panto. Um, In Lincoln, and a friend of mine, well, a guy who I had just met, we had gone for dinner, and he was just talking away, and I said, Oh, I've just missed the deadline for the Royal Academy of Music, I would, that's where I'd like, I'd love to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:00] Kris: And he said, you haven't missed the deadline, because I'm on the course at the minute. This guy who I'd just met, um, he said, the deadline was Friday. So you could fill your form in and get it sent. So I was like, Oh, brilliant. Okay, I'll do that. We went back to rehearsals and they said, we are so far ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:18] Kris: You can have like Thursday and Friday off, but just be back on. Come back on Friday. Saturday. Um, no, come back on Friday for Friday and Saturday. So I, I got in the car, we got in the car, drove down. I had just finished doing Starlight for Arlene Phillips and I messaged, sent Arlene an email saying, Arlene, would you do me a favour?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:39] Kris: Would you do a mere reference? Because we needed references. And then another MD who I'd worked for and I got, they sent me them through and I basically just sent it on the, I went in and I handed it in on the Thursday to make sure that it was there and then I was back on the Friday then I found out that I had to audition and then I'm sure that the only reason I got in was because Arlene had said, had said Well it's not a bad referee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:02] Kris: Oh it's not a bad referee, I mean it's pretty much The best kind of reference. But it was, and I'm so grateful to it. It was just, Arlene's always been a big supporter of people who work for her and, um, I was just, there wasn't, I know, you do kind of go, oh, but would she do it for me? But then she's just the nicest person and she, she, yeah, she did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:24] Kris: And, uh, So then that's how I, that's how I ended up going to the Royal Academy. Followed H into a stepped tribute band. Followed H to the Royal Academy. There you go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:42] Oren: You've played a large variety of roles. Um, doing sort of, Lots of different things and I'm really curious to know about the process to prepare for kind of the different types of roles that you're playing and then the differences between touring and non touring and that kind &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:56] Kris: of thing. Yeah, I mean, with regards to preparing for a role, there's a lot of musical theatre where it has to be played a certain way, um, or it's traditionally played a certain way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:07] Kris: So, as much as you have the scope to, to create and to mould. Your character, your version of this character. You also have. the marks that you have to hit. Um, so then I always start with, uh, well, I mean, I look at, I look at the play or the musical as a whole, and look at the character and think, what does the character, what does my character want?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:36] Kris: But that, what, what is the objective of the character? And then I, as in for the whole play, and then I look at it scene by scene, pretty much the same. So I look at it, um, I look, what, uh, what's my objective, objective of The song, or of the scene, who am I talking to, uh, where are we, what time of, what time is it, it could be the time of the day, the season, it could be autumn, it could be winter, which, Or the era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:02] Kris: Like, all of those things change how you would hold yourself. Like, when I was in Phantom, I wore a waistcoat a lot of the time. So then that automatically holds you, holds you a certain way. I look at, um, and then I kind of action what I am, what I am doing alongside my other, the other people that I'm playing opposite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:23] Kris: Um, not as in action, like action man. Or like, gestures, should I say. Um, More like, what am I doing to this character? What am I, what am I doing? And then I work through, I work through it like that. And then once I've kind of got that in my head, I just kind of think, oh well, okay. I've done the work, now, now I can just live it and then we can start to create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:46] Kris: But I've always got a base to go back to. And is that, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:49] Claire: now I can live it moment, is that the moment you feel you can start to have the two things meld together, the character and you? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:56] Kris: Yeah, I suppose so. I mean, that's when you, once you kind of, once I've done that kind of, the groundwork and the, and the actioning, and I've considered the backstory and the actioning, or you could call it just subtext.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:10] Kris: Once that's kind of part of me, I can then go, I can put that down and go, okay, I can forget about that because that's my baseline. And then I can start to play and really start to, really start to create. Um, that's how I tend, that's how I tend to, yeah. Prepare. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:28] Oren: Is it the same process then for, um, you know, if you're playing a lead role or if you're playing ensemble, if you're doing other things, do you do the same process regardless of the, the type of role?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:39] Kris: I mean, yeah, I suppose so, but not, not to such a level, you know, if you're playing, if you're playing a huge role, then it's evident what you want. But sometimes if you're, if you're in the ensemble, I mean, for me, I always, I, I hate, there's nothing worse than being on stage. And rhubarbing, you know, oh, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, because it just looks naff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:03] Kris: And so for me, I always, even if I'm in an ensemble or playing different characters, I always give that character a name, and I always give it a, for example, I was, um, when I was in Saturday Night Fever, I was in the ensemble and I played a character called Luke. And, um, along with about eight understudies, uh, but that character, that particular character, um, he, he worked two jobs because his mum was, was poorly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:30] Kris: And, uh, he was supporting her and, and, uh, and his brother, uh, there was no father in sight and he was working two or three jobs just to kind of make ends meet. And he would, and he didn't used to go to the club every Saturday. He would go maybe once every month or once every two months, which then. I then took into the piece, or like I would save up, I don't know, the tiniest amount to save for a new shirt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:56] Kris: And so then that made me appreciate going to the club so much more, which then gave me something to work with. Whereas if I just went, okay, I'm on, then I'm just smiling at people like, like I'm smiling at you across the table, then, then it's, then it's fake. But if me just being that character and nobody probably would have noticed, but it made a difference to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:16] Kris: And then I like, and I think that integrity is, is a, is a huge thing when, when, you know, being part of a show is such a huge honor and regardless of. where you are, whether you're the lead or whether you are, um, a featured ensemble, or if you're an ensemble with no covers. I think to have your integrity in the forefront of your, the forefront of your persona is what helps you get re employed again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:39] Kris: Because then people see that you're not taking the piss and that you take, that you take it seriously. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why I, why I've had such a lovely career. I've had a lovely time. And. But I, I believe that your, and I say this to my students a lot, your, your, your reputation is in the room before you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:05] Kris: So if you've been messing around on a show, there's been shows that I've been on where they've had people pulled into the office and they've been reprimanded. Or for example, my, my husband is a resident director, and he's come home and said, Oh, I had this person in the office. Um, and, He would be then be reluctant to employ those people again or recall those people for a show again because he knows about them or the amount of times that people, people have phoned me up and said, Oh, what do you, what do you think about this person?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:38] Kris: But then that's my reputation. If I say they're really good yet, they employ them and they mess around. So your reputation always enters the room before you. And I think that's to have integrity and to, to actually care about what you're doing. I have a little bit of pride in what you, in what you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:57] Kris: Punctuality, knowing your, knowing your words, knowing, knowing your harmonies as soon as you can. And always being, always being prepared. You can still have fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:07] Claire: Yeah, it's knowing where the, um, the boundaries of playtime are. Because actually if you don't bring playtime with you as well, you can't do the job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:15] Claire: Oh, exactly. Knowing where that. But &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:17] Kris: knowing where the line is. Yeah. You know, don't get me wrong, there's been times where I've been on stage and I've absolutely, things have happened and I've kind of, it almost makes it funnier when you're trying not to. To laugh and you go off and then you lose it, but then yeah, I don't know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:33] Kris: I just think to have um, a little bit of pride and a little bit of integrity at the forefront of everything that you do, whether you're build, when you're building a character or whether you are learning a huge role is, it pays dividends. And I think that's probably why I've worked for such a long time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:52] Kris: Not necessarily because, and this isn't me self deprecating, but like I wasn't the best dancer in the world. I'm not the best actor in the world. I'm not the best singer in the world. But I do care. And putting that in front of everything, then that makes people want to, to employ you. And, you know, I'm not saying that I can't sing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:13] Kris: I, you know, I can't sing and, and I love it. And there's nothing, there's nothing that I love more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:20] Claire: Did that, did that develop that integrity? Or was that there from the beginning of your &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:26] Kris: Well, like I said, it was a bit of an airhead, but I always wanted to do well. I think the integrity was always there. And I, but whether I, um, I think it was more, I think there was a handover from an ugly pride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:44] Kris: And then a hand over towards, like, real, real integrity. And what? Like, say when people would come and see the show, I would literally, I would just want that kinesthetic feedback to be so high, that I was like, oh god, I've worked really, really hard, and they're not going to be able to say that I'm not very good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:59] Kris: So it was, it came more from that than it did from me actually going, have I been honest? Have I told the story to the best of my ability? And actually, also, I think there's a, there's a level of acceptance that, you know, I might do a performance, and you might. I think that I was the best thing that, best thing since sliced bread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:19] Kris: You might go and go, I didn't really like him. But then you can't control that. You, you can't control what people think. And actually what people think of you is none of our, is none of your business. Because you can't control it. So why, why waste energy trying to control the things that you can't control?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:35] Kris: So control the controllables. And all I can control is what I put into my work. And that's what, that's, that's what &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:42] Claire: I do. That transition from one form of that into its current, sort of sounds like a more adaptive form. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:52] Kris: I think that comes through just with maturing. I mean, I was very, I was very young. When I first went to, to MAD College, I was 19 years old, but I, I think I was still like a 15, 16 year old lad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:26:04] Kris: I was, like I said, I was a bit of an airhead. Um, And I was just so blasé about absolutely everything, but the handover really started to happen when I understood acting a little bit more. So when I went, when I'd been to the Royal Academy of Music, so quite late on, actually, um, and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:26:32] Kris: having been to college with some great performers, I mean, there were some great people in my year. And I just saw the integrity and I just saw the focus and the calm that they had, whereas I was, I never had that. It was all like, I've got to do this, I've got to do best now, and I've got to look angry, so I'm going to look angry and I've got to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:26:47] Kris: But I never really understood it. Um, So I think, I think it was probably, that was the moment that I was like, Ah, you've been doing it wrong all these years. And now's the time to, to calm down. And to kind of, and, and change what, and actually, Do it because you care because I always cared, but it was more important that people valued rated what I did and I didn't understand that taking care of something truly taking care of something is what is what would truly get me what I wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:15] Kris: So I just thought that going straight in head on full out is what would make people think that I was good. It wasn't. That's not that's not true. I think that having been that bullied child, you want people to. Rate you and want people to like you and want people to, to, to value what you do. And so just trying harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:47] Kris: You think that you are, you are on the right path. And actually there was a lot of moments that, um, I remember there was a, an acting teacher that I had at my first college called Ian Kin, and there was lots of things that he said. Once I. That once I had that lightbulb moment that I was, Ian said that. And I, and I, it was almost like I was learning from my past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:08] Kris: From what teachers had said because I was recalling things that had been said. Um, as well as what I was learning at the academy and from, from my peers and. Seeing the way that they worked and, and that was when I started, felt like I started to piece together the person or the performer that I became.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:32] Kris: Does that make sense? Yeah, totally. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:34] Claire: Totally, it makes sense. So does that then, did that change your experience of being a working performer after that? I think &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:49] Kris: there was a spell of, there was a spell of leaving the Academy where I, I still, I was still being pulled back to default. I think for about a year, I didn't really work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:01] Kris: Because I felt like I was like, I knew what I wanted to be, but I was so, not attached, but I was so, it was, the default setting was so strong that I felt it was a bit of a push and pull thing going on there. But then once I, I got my first job and I was able to put into practice what I what I'd learned and what, and, and then I could start them all together, which was another, I did, um, Iolanthe at the Union and I played the Fairy Queen, uh, in the all male Iolanthe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:31] Kris: And I think that was a challenge in itself because if you're playing a woman, you don't want to be sending it up. You'd have to be, you'd have to be totally real. So that was actually the perfect opportunity to, or being thrown in the deep end, to actually put into practice having real. care and, and integrity with, with what I did, and to, it would have been easy to have sent it up, to have sent it up and it made it a bit more palatable, but I didn't want to, and I just, I just loved it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:07] Kris: And then from then on, that's when things started, things started to roll. And you know, everybody has a time and everybody has, you know, everybody gets their chance. Um, And I just think that at that, after that moment, that was my moment and things, uh, offers started to come in and I was really, I was really lucky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:26] Kris: I mean, I think luck's got a lot to do with it, but I also, I think that like, focus and, and, and the talent has, Is is part of it. But a luck is a, is a real part of it. Yeah, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:38] Claire: it is. It is. And to and to pretend otherwise would be ridiculous. Mm-Hmm. . But you have to show up in that lucky moment. You have to show up with the skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:47] Claire: Oh, the readiness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:47] Kris: Absolutely. Luck and hit the ball in the net. Yeah, yeah. Like you say. Yeah. Yeah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:51] Oren: Absolutely. How do you go from performing to now starting your own? school West End &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:58] Kris: Prep. I haven't just started it. We started it in lockdown. Well, actually it wasn't, it was just before lockdown. It was, I think we had our first day on March the 1st, 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:11] Kris: It's a bi weekly program. We did our first session, which was great. And then we did our second session two weeks later, and then we went into lockdown. And so we were like, what are we going to do? Because what we did is we got, uh, we got everybody pays their fees for the term upfront. And we had all this money in the bank that we were thinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:28] Kris: We're going to have to give back to all these people, but there had been six months prep leading up to us opening the school and it's not we didn't want to give the money back, but we didn't want to give the school up and one of the mums is really tech savvy and she said to us, um, Why don't you go online?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:48] Kris: And this was literally before any of the big colleges went online. I think, didn't lockdown happen on a Friday? I think it happened on a Friday, didn't it? Yeah, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:57] Claire: it did. Because my last day of work was a Thursday. Yeah, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:59] Kris: yeah. And we opened, we, we went online on the Monday. And so on the Saturday, I know it was ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:10] Kris: Um, and she had given it, she had said, there's this program, there's this, um, platform called Zoom. So she talked to me what I had to do with it, and I'm such a technophobe, and she talked me about downloading it and how to, how to install it. And it worked, and we, and then on the Sunday, Mark, Kristen, who helps us run the school, and myself, we went on Zoom and we were like, Right, what can we do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:34] Kris: What can we do to make this work? Um, and we ended up putting together a fifteen hour schedule from the week, because the kids weren't even at school. So, they were like doing three hours a day, and they would have like, they would, We did, like, analyzing text, we did competitions, we did dance classes, we had people from Broadway, Rochelle Rack from Broadway, we had people from West End Shows, um, doing dance classes, we had, um, casting directors, big London casting directors coming in and working with the students, and it just snowballed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:08] Kris: And I mean, that was like full on lemons that we got. We made the tastiest lemonade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:16] Claire: Totally did. Did you not do, like, a nightly Wasn't there a nightly dance session or something? Oh, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:21] Kris: on Instagram. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:23] Claire: Because me and my kids did that. Yes. More than once. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:25] Kris: So it was literally, like, you could see like, all of our kids were like, were really loving the dance classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:32] Kris: And we just went, right, let's do it. And so every night at six o'clock, this was, This was literally like the first week of lockdown. We decided we were going to do some weekly dance classes. And then, and I think in my mom's front room, because we were up at my parents house when lockdown kicked in. Um, and so, yeah, we were, we, we were stuck up there for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:52] Kris: Uh, we just. Set the set the iPad up and did some dance classes. And I think, like some classes, we had about 800 people on. It was ridiculous. It just, it just seemed to take off. But &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:06] Claire: what had given you the idea to start the school in the first place? Because &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:11] Kris: we wanted a little bit more money. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:14] Oren: ha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:14] Oren: No, no, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:15] Kris: no, no. Honesty on this. No, no, no. I mean, I mean, to be fair, it was something that we wanted to add to our. We were not. To add to all that, both, both Mark and I have always talked, even when we've been doing, even when we've been doing, um, our, our own shows. Um, but when I was up, when I was up in the Northeast, there was never anything like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:38] Kris: Um, And while there are a lot of good colleges up there, there was, there wasn't anything like a, an associate program. So we're not a, a, we're not a school where you come and you do your, your, your, your technique and you do your tap and you do, we're an associate program where people from other schools, you know, come to us and they do ex they, they do extra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:00] Kris: Um, and it, yeah, it just seems to have, it just seems to have taken off and we've just taken our, gone, taken our own premises and, uh, last year, was it last year? No, it was this year. We did Everybody's Talking About Jamie. Um, we do a Christmas concert. every year. We do a summer show every year. And the stand is really superb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:23] Kris: Yeah, they're great. Seeing these videos. They are absolutely brilliant. In fact, a lot of the kids make me feel very untalented and they're like, genuinely you should hear some of the voice. Like even me with the knowledge that I have about voice like, how are you doing this at your age? How are you creating that sound?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:41] Kris: It's they they they they they They genuinely humble me and blow my mind and make me feel utterly useless all at the same time because they're so, they're so brilliant. Um, and I just, I just love it. And, yeah. Do you &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:58] Claire: think that experience at MADD of, of, uh, Being in the smaller school and being looked after or, or, or given the space to grow is something that's, that you're giving your young people at WEP?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:36:15] Kris: Yeah, I mean, we don't, originally our ethos totally changed because we were wanting a, like an army, an army of incredible talent. And then the thing is though, even though the ethos has changed to, Something slightly different, we still have that. Um, uh, we didn't, now we don't just want, like, triple threats and people who can, like, dance and kick their faces and, and whack out a top C and act at the most beautiful Shakespearean monologue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:36:44] Kris: We've got a, a group of, a group of, Young individuals who come with their own talents and their own troubles and their own challenges, and it's become more about us helping them as individuals. We do a lot of mindfulness, but we've also woven in that with regards to their, their, their singing and their acting and, and their dancing, and that that's all kind of woven in with what, with what we do with the school as well, and.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:13] Kris: of course getting them to assess their own development, um, and why. And I do with them what you do with us. Um, okay, when they get up and, when they get up and sing, I'll say, well, okay, so what did you like about what you did? Because as performers, we always, Self flagellate if you like. We always kind of go, I don't need to be told that when I've performed and it's bad, I don't need anyone to go, well that, that note was bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:39] Kris: Or, you didn't connect on there, you didn't, you, you, you, that, that bit made no sense. Because I know. I know. I know when I'm bad. Um, but I never give, I've never ever given value to what I've considered a bad performance. in a positive way since I met you, Claire. And actually what it's done is it's made me a much more balanced performer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:03] Kris: And I call it, I call it balancing the seesaw. So if we're constantly putting the negative things on one side, the seesaw's moving down on one side. But then if all you're doing is putting a few a few positives on the other side, it balances it and it's so much nicer. And I think what we're doing with regards to the school is breeding a new generation of balanced performers because now I don't even have to ask them what they liked about what they did or like I'll go did you and some of the ones who aren't dancers come oh no I really struggled but I really tried to do this and I did this and I picked up two eights of it and I was really pleased with myself so it doesn't stop because they're noting the positives then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:46] Kris: That, that, that progression is, seems to be faster. They seem to be progressing at a, at a, at a faster pace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:53] Claire: Because you don't waste time on the self flagellation. Exactly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:56] Kris: Yeah. Exactly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:57] Claire: You can go, okay, that was crap, I need to work on it. But that doesn't wipe me out as a performer. I don't have to climb under the duvet for a week to recover from that performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:06] Claire: I can, I can move straight on &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:08] Kris: and start. And I feel like an utter hypocrite because that's basically, that's literally me for my entire career. I'm like, oh, I'm so dreadful. And I, oh, I should have done this at one point. And I remember coming out of Matilda one night and I had. I had, something had happened, I can't remember what had happened, but I had a really crap show, and this mum came up to me and she was like, you were just, you were really, really, really, and she was, she was really emotional, and I was just like, thank you, and I was like, I couldn't even begin to, it's not that I wasn't, I wasn't impolite, but I was just like, I just want to get, I just want to get away because I was so embarrassed, and the saboteur side of my personality was like, she's patronizing you, but she wasn't, she was genuinely touched by what I did, but I felt it was really dreadful, But that was on the cusp of when I started to work with you, and now, um, I, like, I would just be like, Thank you, like, thank you, because I think there's, whatever we do, there's always something good in what we've done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:07] Kris: And it's how we give value to that, in light of shit happening. And that, that's what balances that seesaw. And I feel so much better from meeting you, I have to say. Oh, very much. As a person. As a friend, and as a mentor to the young. You can't stand me, really. Awkward. If &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:36] Oren: you look back on your journey so far, because you're working with young people now, I think it's really interesting to understand this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:42] Oren: advice, or what, what's the one thing that you would go back to younger version of you and tell them, or advice that you would give them? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:49] Kris: I'd say chill out. Chill out and control the controllables. Yeah. Have integrity. I'd probably be harsher on myself than I am with other people, wouldn't we all? Sure, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:00] Claire: yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:01] Claire: Yeah. But do you think that, do you think that harshness on yourself? is a driving factor? Or do you think you could have done the journey you've done and achieved balance sooner? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:13] Kris: I struggle with perfection, but then I ask what, what is perfection? And what I deem as perfection, like what we said before, you might think what I've done was beautiful and you might think that it was the worst thing you've seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:24] Kris: So, um, perfection, I suppose, is, is relative to the individual or it's in the eye of the beholder. And Who's to say that what are, my idea of perfection is, is, is right. And when I start to sit and think in a positive way, and, and, or analyze, that in a positive way, then I feel so much more balanced. Um, but also learning to not put such high expectations on myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:58] Kris: If you're only ever expecting perfection, then 99. 999 percent of the time you ain't ever going to reach that. So you're constantly going to be disappointed with what you do. And I was sick of feeling disappointed with what I was doing. Because actually, I look back and a lot of the stuff that I've done and videos that I've, I've never been able to watch, I'm like, actually, you know what, that's pretty good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:18] Kris: And I've just beaten myself up for so many years and I don't, I refuse, I refuse to do it anymore. And I refuse to, Sit by and watch the young students that I've got turn into the person that I was. Because I was unhappy with regards to myself for many years. With regards to what I did and constantly feeling like I was a bit of a, a blagger or that I was, um, I mean, this is quite, until quite recently, like I've always believed that I've completely blagged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:51] Kris: My career, and now I know it's not true, but up until relatively recently, I believe that it, that I've got it as by a fluke or by some anomaly something, or that I've, I dunno, they've been desperate and so that's why they've taken me. But do you &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:12] Claire: not think that that's been end de. amongst performers. Oh, absolutely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:15] Kris: That &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:15] Oren: sensation. Like we've spoken to enough people now that have said the same kind of thing, that they feel, you know, either the imposter syndrome or they feel like they shouldn't or they don't deserve where they've been. I think it's, I think you're right. I think it isn't. I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:32] Claire: think it also comes down to Something else I was going to ask you from listening to you then, which is how do you balance understanding that there's no such thing as perfection with the elite level that you're asked to perform at in professional theatre?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:51] Claire: We are striving for excellence. You've given up calling that perfection, which is really healthy, but you know, nonetheless, we are striving for the best it can possibly be. And I think. The two really, if you're not careful, can really feed one another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:09] Kris: Yeah, I mean, I think I've, I've been a, a round peg trying to fit a square hole, you know, into your entire career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:15] Kris: And I think jobs that I've got, I've been, you have to be something that you're not necessarily right for, especially if you're an understudy. You, you might not be perfect for that role. You've to do it. Um, and I think that you can't control. The way that you look. You can't control the way that you sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:33] Kris: You can't control All you can control is what you can control. Like, which is the work. If you can control the work and your focus. Then that's all, that's all you can do. And I think as soon as I realized that I was sick of trying to be a square peg when I was round peg, that's when you, that's when I tend, like, let go of the, of, of, of the issues with perfection and,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:07] Kris: not that I care, not that I care any less, I still care, I still want what I want to be good, and I still want it to be rated, but, I still understand that I might not be someone's cup of tea, and accepting that is, is the most wonderful, is the most wonderful thing. Um, but yeah, I think just controlling what you can, what you can, what you can control is the fundamental parts of how you get a job, how much work you put in, um, and go in and, Deliberate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:41] Kris: And like going into an audition room, like with Secret Sing, it's such a brilliant thing because you are kind of bridging the gap between rehearsing or practicing it in a safe space, and then going into. The lion's den, where all of a sudden you, your anxiety is through the roof and you've got to deal with your, your breathing being higher or, and the, the blood racing and, and, and, and the, the, the thoughts that pop into your head, like they're writing something down or they're looking at my picture or, or he's not, he's not even looked at me once and dealing with all of those kinds of things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:14] Kris: But then that goes off onto a different tangent. Dealing, uh, you know, dealing with those things, you can have, you can go to, to therapy. Or you can go to Secret Sing. Um, and, and I think Secret Sing is pretty much like therapy, but it also, there's the bridging of, there's the, there's the bridging of that gap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:34] Kris: Which I think is. Very important. It's very, very important because going in with an elevated heart rate or an elevated, uh, breathing, um, it sounds like nothing, but it's a massive thing. So, to deal with that, or it being more familiar, then you go in. It's it being more familiar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:57] Claire: Yeah. You're not trying to relocate it in any way, because that's unrealistic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:01] Kris: Because if you're familiar, if you're familiar with it, it's, it's not that it's part of your comfort zone, but if it's more familiar, then you're able to, you know, It's, it's, it's, you've dealt with it before, so you know that it's You can control what you do in those elevated moments. You rewrite the story, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:19] Claire: what &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:20] Kris: it means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:20] Kris: Absolutely. I didn't talk about the difference between touring and More &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:25] Oren: just, um, the demands really, the understanding of Well, first of all, your preference, if you enjoyed one over &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:33] Kris: the other. I prefer working in town only because I think as I've gotten older. The desire to to be part of a show back then was so intense that if it was a number one tour and I was I was in the, I was in the ensemble and then I had to sweep the floor and then I had to go and iron everybody's costumes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:55] Kris: I would have done it back then, because I, I, because I hadn't done it. But I think as I've gotten older, to be able to have that and have routine and, be able to live my life, that's much more appealing to me. I mean, at the minute, my husband's away on tour, um, and I would never stop, I would never stand in his way of him doing anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:19] Kris: But fortunately, his contract is only three days a week, so I get to have him home for four days a week, and he's, he's away for three. So it's not so bad. But if he was away on tour all of the time, I would personally hate it. And, and, or if I was away on, if I was away on tour, Then I don't think I, I, I, I wouldn't, I couldn't handle it and also your values change when you get older.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:40] Kris: I've got a dog who's 13 and I don't, I couldn't take him on tour. I mean, I could, but it'd be really unfair and it'd be really unkind and I don't want to do that to him. And I just like having a life and I like getting my clothes out of a drawer and I get my underpants out of the top drawer. And I like, do you know what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:56] Kris: I don't like living, living out of a suitcase isn't for me. You've been together &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:00] Claire: a long time, you and Mark? Yes. Yes. And you're both involved in theatre. Yes. We, you were both performing when you met? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:09] Kris: Mark was the year below me at college. Ah, okay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:13] Claire: So. So how is it, you know, you mentioned one of you being on tour, one of you being at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:18] Claire: How has it been crafting two careers around an industry that's not very well known for its life friendliness? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:27] Kris: Um, Well, for starters, when you're with someone and you know it, and it's right, you know it's right. And I've known it's been right for a very long time. Um, and I think that Mark Mark's very levelheaded, mark's very logical, and I'm just one big emotional&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:49] Kris: Um, but Mark starts to work before me. Mark got Little Shop of Horrors. He did it, um, with, um, Cape Prince and Zoo Nation up at, um, in 1999. Um, in. The, uh, in, uh, the Edinburgh Festival. And then he went straight into Starlight Express in London. So Mark was already, Mark was working and doing what I wanted to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:50:12] Kris: And I got offered some ships and I got offered, uh, uh, uh, a UK, no, a UK and a European tour of a show. And Mark was like, go, just go and do it. This is what you need to do. And I think because he never stood in my way, that really built the relationship. The trust, um, that was a really kind thing to do because he could have quite easily have said I don't, I don't want you to go, I don't want you to go, um, but he never did and I think that because he's never stood in my way and I've never stood in his way, I think that, that's just built such good foundations that we would, you know, of, of trust and, um, and admiration and we never, I think because we, we, he, look very different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:50:55] Kris: We're not, we don't, we're not of a similar kind of ilk. Um, that we were never really in for the same stuff. So there was never that kind of competition, uh, between us. And there was, there'd only ever been support there. Um, and a lot of people say, Oh, I could never be with somebody in, I could never be with somebody in, in the business, but I could never be with somebody who wasn't in the business because he understands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:21] Kris: Everything. He understands what it's, he understands life from an actor's perspective and he understands life from a perspective of, of desperately wanting to be in, in a show and dealing with rejection. And, um, and that's why in my mind, he's the best person I know. Um, if I've not been right about something or if I've been, I've misjudged something, he'll call me out and go, well, I think you're being, I think that's, that's unnecessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:48] Kris: I think you're being, uh, unreasonable, or I think, or he'll go, okay, and he's, but he's just so logical and so, but, but, so supportive. And it, the hard part was being a part. That was the hard part. But knowing that I was allowed, if you call it, I want to say allowed, that he allowed me to go or without kicking off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:12] Kris: And then I've also done the same for him. Then it's just, like I said, it's just built up this most wonderful, um, sense of trust between us. And I think if you hold on to somebody too much, then all they'll want to do is, is have a longer leash or get further away. You let someone go. You let someone go, they'll, they'll, they'll, like, And that's what he did with me and that's what I did with him and I think that's why we're still together 26 years later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:36] Kris: And happier now than we've ever been. So, there you go. So much support, I love it. Really, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:43] Oren: really nice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:44] Kris: Supportive environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:45] Claire: I love it. Um, so this podcast is called The 5 Minute Call. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:49] Kris: And what, we've been talking for an hour and two minutes. And we &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:53] Claire: wondered What you do at the five minute call. Oh, what do I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:56] Kris: do at the five minute call?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:59] Kris: Um, I'm probably still getting ready.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:05] Kris: Oh shit, I've got to get my makeup. Um, uh, I think, no, I'm normally, I'm normally quite, actually on Phantom, I was always late down. I don't know what it was about that show, but I was always late down. It was like, Chris Manuel, please come to the stage. We've had, we've had clearance. I'm like, where's my wig?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:25] Kris: Like, oh no, I was, I was, I was dreadful on that show, but like other shows like Matilda or Billy, I was all like at the five, I'd say at the five and I would just get down, I'd get down the stage because I was, I just wanted to do the show. And what's, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:38] Claire: what's going through your mind at that &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:39] Kris: point? Just, I, I depends it differs from show, it would differ from show to show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:44] Kris: Okay. And what track you're on for or, um, or if you've had any notes. Um, if I've had a, if I, if, if I was on for a cover, I would take a list of notes down and I would leave it in the wings. So I would go and I'd be looking on, okay, I've gotta remember I've got do, I can't, I've gotta do that. I, oh shit, I've gotta do that as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:05] Kris: Okay. And then I would put it, and I would go through my, go through my mind, what I, what I have to do. But if it's in a track that I. No, I'm just getting myself, I'm just on, I'm just getting ready to go on stage and do what we all wish we were doing, you know, like, I'm not in a show now, and like, I would love nothing more than to be in a show, and like, that's why I say I would do, do what I wish I was doing, because there's nothing, I mean, don't get me wrong, the school is absolutely everything, and I adore it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:40] Kris: But also at the same time, Alec, I miss being, I really miss being in a show, I miss the camaraderie, I miss the, you know, the banter with people backstage, and I miss the, the smell of the grease paint, the horror of it all, yeah. But yeah, I wish you'd asked me that. I wish I, you know, I wish I had a better answer for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:59] Kris: But that's a great answer. It's the honest answer. I love it. But yeah, probably, probably panicking backstage thinking, Shit, I've got to be downstage on stage now. I'm going to get put in the show report for being late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:12] Claire: So we have one last thing for you. Okay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:14] Kris: What? So reading. Is this what you said to us? I forgot to read. This is why you might &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:18] Oren: need to practice. So, we ask all of our guests to write a question for the next guest in this book and we don't get to see it. Nobody gets to see it. Do you not know what it is? I have no idea what this question is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:30] Oren: No. Old, 20 years old, 30 years old. What would you say to your younger self? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:34] Kris: Well, 10 year old. Um, I don't know whether it would be something worth, with regards to the business, should I say. Well, I would probably just give an insight of what my life, what life has become and it's not what I expected it to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:48] Kris: At that age, I, like I said, I was very, I was really bullied and I didn't tell anybody. I didn't tell my parents. I kept it hidden from the school and, um, little did I know that being able to con, not to, not to hide that, but to kind of deal with that at such a young age without telling anybody, that was, I suppose that was a bit of a, It's given me a bit of a superpower to deal with a lot more, um,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:21] Kris: a lot more than I probably think I can. So I would probably thank myself, to be honest, for being Resilient guy. As, yeah, as strong as I was. Yeah. Um, dosh, I didn't expect that to, to get me. Um, but yeah, I would probably thank myself and probably that life's worth. Something that I didn't, that I probably would never have expected to have had back then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:53] Kris: And especially growing up gay as well, you know, that was like a massive thing. So like you were hiding being gay, you were, I was like hiding being bullied and I was hiding being, um, you know, all of that stuff. Um, but I just think that I was a fucking brave little soldier. So I'm quite, I would like, I, like I just, I would just, Give myself a round of applause for being that person, even though I just thought that back then I was weak and I was shameful and I was an embarrassment, even though now, like, I know that I'm not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:26] Kris: My parents never made me feel like that. They always made me feel powerful and worthy. But I just, I think because of the time, that was, um,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:44] Kris: that was a really shit time to grow up being gay. And especially like at the height of the AIDS pandemic and stuff like that and seeing all those awful Um, adverts and things, and that becomes part of you&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:05] Kris: and the way that you go through life and the way that you conduct yourself with people. Yeah. And then 20 years old, I would say, calm the fuck down, calm the fuck down. Um, and then 30 years old. What was I doing? What was I doing? I was 30 years old. What was I? Calm the fuck down. I'd probably say the same thing again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:34] Kris: Um, yeah, that's probably it. Chris, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:40] Claire: thank you so, so &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:41] Kris: much. for having me. Thank you. Thank you very much for having &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:44] Oren: me. This has been, wow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:58:48] Kris: It was lovely. Thank you. You know, you made me cry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[00:00:00] Oren: Hello, and welcome to the 5 minute call. This is a podcast where we take a deep dive into the stories of the people that make theater happen. Today, we're talking to Alexia Kadeem, who has had a fearsome career in musical theater. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:12] Claire: Alexia has appeared in productions which include The Lion King, Le Miserables, and The Book &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:17] Oren: of Mormon.

Okay. So tell us where little Alexia &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:38] Alexia: When I was younger, I would always sing. I think The love for watching people like Whitney Houston on TV, the Pointer Sisters. I mean, it was so severe that the Pointer Sisters, I wanted hair like them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:00:49] Alexia: And I remember there was a day my mom was in the kitchen and they had their hair in a particular hairstyle. And I was like, I want that hairstyle. And I took To the scissors and cut. I cut my hair and then my mom came back in the room. She was like, Alexa, what have you done?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:08] Alexia: And I was like, don't worry. We can put it back because I'd seen, like, extensions and stuff, but I didn't realize, you know, like, you you can't just put it back. My mom was traumatized by that, but, you know, like like, I love the Pointer Sisters. I loved all of that. And it was only when I got to probably about In my teens, really, um, when somebody said to my mum, have you thought about her doing, like, vocal training and stuff?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:32] Alexia: Was that a teacher or a No. That was just somebody who had said to my mom, you know, like, you should do something with that voice because, I mean, whether it was in the supermarket, whether it was, I sung everywhere. Like, I was that child who would skip down the road, and I was always doing something. I was the 1 who was putting on shows for Sit down on a Saturday after ballet. You know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:53] Alexia: Sit down and everyone has to pay. Right? That's your ticket. Right. So now putting on a show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:01:58] Alexia: Like, I was that with my cousins and stuff. Like so, um, like, I guess people had, like, had heard me, you know, like like, you should do something with that, and it was only later when I started Get my voice trained, but my mom did put me into dance classes and drama sort of classes like after school or on a Saturday sort of thing Just to kind of, I guess, exercise all the energy. You know, like but because I just did I enjoyed it. I loved dancing. I absolutely loved dancing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:02:25] Alexia: Was anybody in your family into No. Really, really. Where did they come from? I don't I don't really actually know. A lot of people say, are there, like, singers, like, In your fact, they're my family can sing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:02:38] Alexia: Yeah. There are members who can sing, but nobody it wasn't career bound. Like, there isn't Many that I kind of unless I don't know. I mean, I'm I'm not particularly too, like, sure of that. But, um, Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:02:55] Alexia: And, like, I do the figure skating, I do the ballet, I did, like yeah. Like, it was all just kind of good fun, so to speak. And so then when somebody did say to my mom and I've been doing, like, like, dance classes and all that fun stuff, like, on Saturday sort of thing. And I started to get my voice So I guess having singing lessons privately, and I was doing opera in my teens, and, like, I Also was doing, like, the drama classes, um, after school, but then school was important. So, like, I had to take a back seat a little bit on that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:03:26] Alexia: But that's kind of How from have going to those, like, um, drama classes and all of that, I the woman had an agency, and She would send me up for audition. So I'd done TV work and stuff when I was younger, so I did Grange Hill. I did, yeah, I did The Queen's Nose. I did, um, commercials for, like, Chez into a world of adventures. I did stuff like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:03:49] Alexia: Um, I did the bill. Gosh. Is that still around? I don't think it You know, like, I did stuff like that, but my first kind of theater job was actually at the Hackney Empire With, um, Susie Susie McKenna, she gave me my first professional theater Job. And I was in that weird in between sort of, like, young sort of I think I just turned 16 At the time And what was it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:18] Alexia: We did Cinderella at the Hackney Emperor and Sharon, um, Sharon d Clark, wasn't it? Clive Roe wasn't it? So So that's so I met them way back then. Wow. And then after that, I then went on tour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:28] Alexia: Like, I just I like because I just was going up for auditions and I was able to get, like, jobs and stuff. I went on a tour and I did, um, the leader of the pack, which was great. I played Ronnie Spector, which was great fun. I just got to wear all the beehive wigs and all that kind of stuff. I then got into Lion King.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:44] Alexia: That was in its early stages of just opening in the West End, and I I covered Nala. Okay. So I was 17. How was that? 17.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:53] Alexia: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 17.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:04:56] Alexia: How was that? It was great fun. It was so much fun. I mean, everyone, It's so funny. Like, now in companies, I find that the average age tends to be quite young, actually, you know, like, I don't know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:09] Alexia: Early twenties, teens. When I was doing it, I was, like, the youngest in the company. There's 1 other person who was Dean, Jonathan, Andrew Hume, and, um, everyone else was in their thirties Or early thirties. And it's so funny now how that's not really the case. No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:29] Alexia: But everyone else was kind of in their thirties, so I was really young In comparison to them, you know, but I really got along with them. You know, like Were &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:37] Claire: you still at school during this period, or had you &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:40] Alexia: I I I was actually. So I stayed on to do my a levels in psychology, ink literature, and maths. Nothing at all with industry Whatsoever. I don't know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:50] Alexia: Psychology is pretty high up. I know. True. True. True.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:05:53] Alexia: That's very true. That's true. And psychology was the thing that really I I was like, if anything, that's what I'll probably do. And then because I have got the opportunity to go on tour, I was like, Well, this doesn't come around every day. This will be fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:08] Alexia: Bye, guys. Do you know what I mean? So that's how I kind of ended up kind of getting into the industry, and I just Kept on getting, like, jobs. Were your parents supportive of that decision? Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:18] Alexia: Yeah. My mom was always supportive. Amazing. Um, it was, you know, It was an opportunity, but I did like the mentality even when I got into Lion King was, okay, well, I'll do this, and then I'll just have to go back and Do but then I got another job. You know, um, um, at 1 point, I did some stuff in the music industry, Um, also and I did also, like, with Star on the Wind, I did another tour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:43] Alexia: So I toured a couple of times, and then I came back to Lion King. So yeah. And then just things have kind of, like, spiraled and done a whole bunch of other shows within the West End. Do you think &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:55] Claire: you'd imagined that No. You know, pre 15?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:58] Claire: Had you No. It wasn't seen &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:06:59] Alexia: that at all? It was never a career in my mind. This was fun, and this was a moment, and it's an opportunity, and we're gonna enjoy this and have it as an experience. But now after that, we're gonna find what The career is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:13] Alexia: That's why whenever somebody asks me, I'm always like, I I feel like my career picked me as opposed to Me picking it, and that's not necessarily the wrong way around or anything, um, or the right way around. It's just that's the way it kind of Happened for me. I felt like it it almost wasn't my choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:32] Oren: Where did you feel it transitioned from being Fun, hobby, having a good time to this is now a job. This is a thing that we've got to focus on as &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:41] Alexia: a career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:42] Alexia: It was After interesting. When I went back to Lion King the second time around where I played Nala, I was like, hey. Great. Well, I've ticked that off because I remember seeing Lion King and being like, I wanna play that role. That would be great fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:07:57] Alexia: That's it's still fun in my mind. Right? And then I've now played this role, and I was like, oh gosh. Well, I better stop thinking about going back to do that psychology. Um, but then I auditioned for Wicked, Pippa Alien.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:15] Alexia: I remember her Seeing me for something else at the time, and she said to me, have you looked at that material? And I was like, no. Why would I? Like, that's not a casting for me. And she was like, look at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:29] Alexia: And then I was called in to audition for it. But again, I didn't think that it was really a thing, and it was really only after I got the job and done that job where I was like, oh, 0, this is my career. Mhmm. It took a while because it there was nothing informing me, I think, Within the industry, I didn't know very much about the industry neither, um, that was saying there's a place for you here, and this is this could actually be a career for you. Nothing was nothing was pointing in that direction for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:08:59] Alexia: So yeah. Do you think &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:02] Claire: that gave you permission to be more playful with it at the beginning? I would &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:05] Alexia: say I'm more I guess so in some respects, Being that there isn't the pressure of thinking, I need that next job. Yeah. Do you know what I mean?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:16] Alexia: Like I mean there is there is that. And so there is less There was, I think, less pressure of walking in the room and doing an audition and thinking, I've gotta Get this. Do you know what I mean? Like, there wasn't. There was, this will be fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:32] Alexia: Yeah. You know? And I think audition rooms can afford to kinda change to Have a little bit more of that creative space, actually. Yeah. I think when I was younger, I was being even more so authentically myself Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:09:46] Alexia: In the room because you you there is especially having just I think I pretty much stopped doing, like, drama classes at the age of, like, 13, you know, like, going to, like, the drama class on a Thursday and being able to see your friends and Yeah. You know, or do some improv and, you know, like yeah. Um, so it it's that thing of, like, oh, it's there's this fearlessness of, oh, I don't know how this works. I've never no one's told me how I go into an audition. Uh, you know, like, my mom will always present yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:22] Alexia: Mom will always say to me, like, present yourself. But, like, You would just go in, and I was told, okay, you gotta sing the song. I always was prepared. Like, that's what we do. Do you know what I mean?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:30] Alexia: That was just something that my mom had instilled in me From the get go, but there was no hard and fast. Like, I never thought, okay. I've got to do this. I've got to do that. There was never any pressure on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:40] Alexia: I think that's probably A &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:42] good &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:42] Claire: thing. It sounds like a fantastic thing. It sounds like what There was a so many people are chasing that feeling, and yet there's So much weight on an audition usually. Yeah. There's, you know, your next 6 months are paying the rent or whatever it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:10:55] Claire: There wasn't that. Amazing to have the opportunity of being able to go in almost with a naivety by the sounds of &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:01] Alexia: things. Hundred percent. Hundred percent. And also my mom also was really good at Saying what's for you is for you and what's not for you, you'll be glad for it not being there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:14] Alexia: Do you know what I mean? And And don't worry when 1 door closes, another opens. I mean I mean, I don't know also if that's from when I was younger doing TV and, like, not getting jobs. You know, um, and my mum having to explain it to me from such a young age, that wasn't for you because you've you're gonna do something else. You know, like, some of that Could be good for the youth of today of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:11:40] Alexia: If you don't get this thing now, maybe you're not ready for it now. Maybe it's later on. You know? Mhmm. You'll never get more than your portion, and what Comes to you comes to you at the right time because you're ready for it at that time, and there's something that you've got to go through as a learning curve For that future thing that's coming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:02] Alexia: It it &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:03] Oren: feels very much like those experiences you've had early on have really informed These ideas Yeah. Which I think is great. Yeah. How do you think that it has informed Artistry. What what I mean by that is like, do you think those early experiences in working on television have informed how you now approach a role and go about, You know, just, uh, work on a character and then going and &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:28] Alexia: performing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:28] Alexia: I think that was something, like, that I'd learned before. You you're winging it In some respects. Do you know what I mean? You really are because you're just like, okay. Well, this is good, and this is how I would just do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:12:38] Alexia: You're not even really thinking about all necessarily the layers. Whereas I think as you get older and you're in the industry and you're learning from people who are around you and what's not, that actually there's a lot more layers in terms of, like, How you then approach something. So how I maybe, um, approach something now is not necessarily how I would have approached it when I was younger. It was kind of like all on feeling, and this is how I would say it, and this is how I would do it. Whereas now you're, like, looking at the more perspective of where has that person been?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:08] Alexia: Where did they just come from? Why are they feeling this way? What is their relationship with that character? You'll think about all of those things now. So Even when I'm singing a lyric in a show, I'm thinking about why I'm singing that lyric.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:24] Alexia: Whereas before, it was you were just singing. Yeah. You know? Yeah. I think what is important now for me, even more so, is that I find it Hard now to sing a lyric without knowing why I'm singing that lyric.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:40] Alexia: It has to make sense to me. Otherwise, it does just kind of It it I tell spin in my head. I'm like, it just doesn't make sense though. But now I'm just singing these notes for the sake of singing these notes. I don't wanna just sound Nice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:13:54] Alexia: Lots of people can sound nice, and it can sound pure, and it can sound beautiful and be pitch perfect. Sometimes I want a little bit of that imperfection because, Actually, it's that imperfection that kind of makes it perfect because we are imperfect human beings. And even when we're Explaining things in life, and I'm giving you a window into my soul or into that moment on stage. I want you to see a little bit of that imperfection. It's not about the Perfection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:21] Alexia: It's not about that perfect no. I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:23] Oren: really love this. I really love it because I've seen a a a lot of interviews and I've read a lot. And In a lot of the things that in the way that you describe that you're described as a performer is very different from how you might describe others in the, like, your performance style. And I think it's this that sets that apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:43] Oren: Yeah. It's Finding that imperfection that actually brings more of that honest performance. Yeah. Anybody can stand there and sound pretty. I had to say a &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:52] Alexia: hard thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:14:52] Alexia: It could you could you but the problem is that we we can zone out. Yeah. No matter how fantastic that song is. Yeah. You'd be like, oh, that was really pretty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:01] Alexia: Wasn't that lovely? Oh, that was nice. When she hit that note, that was nice. I don't want you talking about the note that I hit. I want you talking about what I'm evoking in that moment and the story that I'm telling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:16] Alexia: Like, you'd hear people say, like, oh, I can't bear musical theater. They're they're just gonna break out into song. But it should technically be just a monologue. It's a win it's it's literally you being able to see this moment. You're getting almost like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:32] Alexia: It's it's a zooming in. And sometimes a lot of the story is actually in the music and in the lyrics that you're singing. So why are we wasting it away on these wonderful notes and something that has been written beautifully? Fantastic. We love it when something's been written beautifully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:15:48] Alexia: But why not add the other layer Of what you're trying to say because, ultimately, I want the audience to be able to connect with me or maybe find something, like, they understand So they can walk away having understood a story and actually see the arc of a character rather than that was Pretty. I don't feel like I've done a great job if somebody says, oh, it sounded lovely. Yeah. Do you know what it was about? Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:17] Alexia: Yeah. How &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:18] Oren: does how does that make you feel from from your perspective? Because a lot of that is, I want the audience to feel this. I want the audience to take this away. What do you get from &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:27] Alexia: it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:31] Alexia: Um, I I find for me, it's not about me saying, oh, I wanna do this and so that the audience go, do the audience feel this? It's not that. It's never that. It's so long as I am connected and I feel like I am Telling the story, and I'm being honest in the moment and present because it's when you're on stage and you're doing the same show every day, You can get stagnant. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:16:53] Alexia: It can get stale, but the idea is to be present. If you are present and you were alert, Then you won't fall into that trap so much. I'm not gonna say it's not gonna happen because I think that's just not humanly possible. But if you were present, Sometimes an actor might deliver something to you differently, which causes a different reaction, and that's what you have to be present for. That might change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:21] Alexia: That whole scene has been now said slightly differently, made the stakes slightly higher today. So then that affects the way then you've sung the song that then leads into that. You know? Do you think I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:33] Claire: have so many questions. I have &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:34] Alexia: so many questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:17:39] Claire: So okay. Just rewind for a second Yeah. Because you were saying that at Beginning, it was more of an instinctual thing. Do can you look back and and see do you think you can see what those casting directors So because now we definitely see somebody with all these skills and all this Wisdom and all this courage to do to do that storytelling. I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:03] Alexia: think they probably saw the potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:05] Alexia: There there's always potential in someone when they're able to read text And convey it. But then there are levels. And when somebody sings well, I think they probably saw the potential of what I had. And then, I guess, through giving me the job, it's then in the rehearsal room Of them being able to then get that out of me, of how to try and get me to be creative and not get locked in. I remember when I was younger, be like, if I got a script and I would say my lines and what's not, and we'd be in rehearsals or whatever, and I'd get into emotion of saying the lines in a particular way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:18:45] Alexia: And if I remotely was given, like, a note to say something in a different way, you're so I was so held on to that way of saying it. I'd almost forget my lines. Do you know what I mean? It just comes back to the psychology of it. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:00] Alexia: Yeah. Yeah. I always forget my lines because you're just You're just married to this thing. You're holding on so tight. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:06] Alexia: You know? Whereas now, I'll get irritated with myself if I'm Holding on to something, and I'm not allowing my mind and myself to be more open and present To how I would react. And also not doing that thing of, well, you said it like this yesterday, so you can't say it like this to to, um, you know, like Today, we can't do that neither because that's still not being present. So that's also so you might say it the same today and yesterday Because that's what it was in that moment. But it's dangerous to get into thing of, well, I sounded like this today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:19:42] Alexia: I must sound like this tomorrow because then you're still You're you're kind of trying to get a a a square into a circle. It's not working, and it gets sticky. And that's when it's not real, and that's Some people can't connect. But if you're present and and there, I feel like you connect better. I just feel like you connect better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:04] Alexia: Do you have I feel more alive. I feel more like I've done my job. Don't get me wrong. I walk away some days and say, Oh, well, that wasn't a good show for me to the media. You know, I've done that in many shows where I've been like, oh, today, I didn't feel like I I just couldn't Find it today, you know, um, but you go back and the beauty is that you get to do it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:27] Alexia: You know? And, you know, And you're on find &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:30] Claire: it easy to sorry. I'm literally backing up &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:33] Alexia: to Adrian. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:36] Claire: Do you find it easy To to get into a new headspace when the show hasn't gone well, to to go back in the next day and be able to put that behind you? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:45] Alexia: Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:20:46] Alexia: I that that has been a learning curve also Because, you know, like, you don't wanna get into the mindset of, well, that happened yesterday. Remember that went wrong. So Yeah. It's to let go. It's like even I used to do this thing, Um, where I had to do the same thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:01] Alexia: So weird before a show. I remember I remember even being in Book of Mormon, like, I used to be I clearly, I was obsessed with hand sanitizer before the pandemic. But I was like, why do I have to sanitize my hands At a particular time because I felt like it would all go wrong. So weird. Like, who does that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:23] Alexia: Do you know what I mean? Like, it's silly things. It's breaking habits so that I don't hold on to them and to know that every day is different, And you can only live in the moment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:35] Claire: Yeah. 1 of the big red flags to me when I'm working with somebody in a production is if they come to me and they say, so I did this Show the other night, and I I knew that number wasn't gonna go well because that note that I do, you know, 15 minutes into the show, that that's kind of my check note.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:21:50] Claire: And if that no good. Then I know the rest of it's not gonna It's not gonna yeah. Super, super tempting as a singer to to have those check notes, but actually Really counterproductive. Yes. Because you're also then just telling your story, yourself a story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:02] Claire: A &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:02] Alexia: hundred percent. Like, you could be in a show, and you're like, Oh, it doesn't feel as great today, but I'll be you know, like, I I feel like I'll be okay. Let's see how it goes. But then as you're going through your show, Your voice cleans up. You can't measure it on the start of your show because by the end of your show, you You got all the notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:23] Alexia: You know? Like, you can be totally fine. So it's just like it's impossible Say, but I mean, like, you've just also got to know for yourself where your line is and when when you have to Stop. How do you learn that? It's a hard lesson to learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:42] Alexia: Sometimes it is you going out there, and you've pushed 1 too many. The following day, you've woken up, and you sounded like Barry White for you to For you to to learn that I should have never have done that. It's like touching the fire. Right? Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:22:57] Alexia: Ow. That burnt me. Yeah. Hello. Wake up call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:01] Alexia: And you can't keep on doing it. And it's a conversation that I always have, but, like, no lozenge is gonna save you. You just have to stop. I think there's a thing of people forget the voice is a muscle. And just like a runner, if he's just Constantly running.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:17] Alexia: Constantly running. It's gonna get tired. You know? Or if it hasn't had the rest Absolutely. It's gonna get tired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:23] Alexia: Right? Right? It's gonna it's gonna get Right. But there is a mentality because our voices are used to speak. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:30] Alexia: That it's just meant to you're a singer, so you sing. That's it. No. You are vocal athlete. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:38] Alexia: That's what you are. And so it's going to get tired, And it's okay. You you know, like, your range is not is not a testament to say, like, you're not good enough. Yeah. I think that's also there's a, um, a not so great mentality around kind of, like, losing voice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:23:56] Alexia: Oh, gosh. She's losing her voice. Or, oh, gosh. She's a like, No. No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:02] Alexia: It's like it happens. You can get a cold. Like, there are so many elements. Emotional stuff Can literally like, if you're stressed, all of these things are factors for our voice. You think About if you're about to cry and how, like, your voice, like, completely, like, trips out, and you could have been totally fine prior to that That very moment before crying, it's connected emotionally, and I think there needs to be a better language And a better understanding around the voice and truly knowing your instrument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:36] Alexia: People can give you advice about things, But it's important for you to know your own voice and where your limits are because you can ask, do you think I should do this? But, ultimately, only you truly know whether you can or you can't. But I say, if you're asking, you probably should &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:24:54] Oren: stop. Is that is that the answer then? So how how does somebody find those limits for themselves?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:00] Oren: How does somebody know? Is it you go to that point, and then Once you have that realization, or is there think &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:05] Alexia: if you're trying to say, like, if you're warming up at home or something, you've got, like, a gig or you know? And your voice is just not Complying or you've got it out a couple of times, all the other times it's not been but if and then you stopped for a while, and then you You you tried again, and it didn't work. I think red flag is what I'm saying. It's like it's waving Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:28] Alexia: Yeah. And that's saying No, actually. As much as you might be able to push through and you might be okay, why would you wanna go on mic? So &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:36] Oren: it's a lot of mindfulness. Mhmm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:38] Oren: Do you practice mindfulness? Do you do any mindfulness activities? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:40] Alexia: Yeah. I do. I I write to myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:25:43] Alexia: I do. I write to myself a lot, And it kind of helps me to compartmentalize and rationalize my thoughts, um, so I don't go down the rabbit hole. Well, I think it's, like, um, something that I've learned to do because you can. You can just spiral where you're second guessing, doubting. But it's it it's good to kind of have some kind of checkpoint, even if it is just a friend to be able to vocalize and help you rationalize Your thoughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:26:16] Alexia: Um, and in this industry, ultimately, I think we've got to remember you are the product. It's not buying, I don't know, a bottle of water and saying this is the product. You are the product, so you're never really kind of letting go. Just think about, like, if I'm doing a show and even if I've got, like, a day off or holiday or something like that, I'm always thinking about my tools. There isn't really a complete off for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:26:43] Alexia: Why is that? I just think we've been given I've been given and blessed with a gift, and It's a part of me. And if it was taken away tomorrow, I would feel like I lost a limb. And that's no disrespect to anyone, but it would genuinely feel like I've lost a massive part of me because it's something Thing that I've always been able to do. Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:06] Alexia: I trained later on in life, but it was just something I thought everyone could sing. I thought everyone could sing. I thought it was just a thing, like talking, like breathing. You know, let's sing together. Yes, guys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:18] Alexia: Let's put on this show. Do you know what I mean? But if tomorrow it was taken away, I would have lost a lot. I would have lost a &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:25] Claire: lot. Did you spend time thinking about that during &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:28] Alexia: the pandemic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:28] Alexia: I think even pre even pre Pandemic. Times where, you know, like, I've got a cold, and it's knocked me out for a long space of time. That Feeling, because I I remember the first time having a a cold that really knocked me for 6, and it was just taking ages for it to, like, come around. It had never happened to me before. Never.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:50] Alexia: Like, my voice was there every time. Sorry. Sorry, guys. It was, like, there every time. Like, it would just be there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:27:59] Alexia: I would always be able to do it. And the day it doesn't, Yeah. That's the fear that you feel. And that you you go through a lot of emotions, and you and it really is a journey Before you can get to a place of, oh, okay. You've you realize in that moment, hold on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:18] Alexia: If I didn't have this, I've gotta look after this Differently. I've gotta make I think that's probably also 1 of the turning points of me really, really knowing my voice. It's that low place of really getting to know your voice. Yeah. Really getting to know and wanting to know The actual science also kind of behind it, how your cords come together, what it means when you're coughing, what it means when you're even, like, You know, like, when you're getting things like postnasal drip or whatever, really what that's actually all doing, all of that stuff, knowing as much information and the more informat I I always wanna learn more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:55] Alexia: You know? I I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:28:57] Claire: don't have a single student who's been through vocal trauma, who isn't on some and it sounds weird to say, But on some level, glad that it happened because they know so much more about their &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:09] Alexia: voice at this point. Hundred percent. Yeah. 100 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:12] Claire: And very often say, as you're saying, that until that point, they're &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:16] Alexia: just kind of used to however.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:17] Alexia: Yeah. You're used to however. And the thing is, When you're young, you got the bounce back. That's what I call it. I call it the bounce back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:23] Alexia: Right? You've got the bounce back, and and you Recover quicker. You you know, like, it's it's great. Right? But you could also be causing a lot of damage along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:29:36] Alexia: And then when it comes, it it's not the nicest. I mean, like, I say French is, um, better than the cure. And, you know, like, The more information that you can learn from when you're younger and simple things like even vocal hygiene of, like, making sure that you're hydrated and that, you know, like, it's Great conditions that your voice is working in and that you don't just go like oh, just because you can wake up and you can sing atop sea, that you don't just wake up and sing atop See that you actually warm your voice still into that that moment. It's things like that. Just don't take it for granted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:08] Alexia: Like, you should just never be singing without Warming that voice and getting it. Back &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:12] Claire: to the mindfulness thing. So I could well imagine somebody hearing this and, again, going down the rabbit hole of Yeah. Okay. I'm looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:18] Claire: How do you How do you balance looking after it, having a deep respect for it, and understanding its importance in your life Mhmm. With That it taking it. Trusting it and Yeah. Allowing yourself to to live. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:35] Alexia: Mine came with just experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:30:38] Alexia: I I wish I had the formula of what exactly that is, but you do have to find balance in that It can't take over your world. I think for me creating boundaries also has helped, and knowing it's okay When to say no? There's looking after your voice, but also not obsessing. You don't wanna be in that place of where you're just It's just you're you're eating, living, breathing. You know, it can't be that because then your voice is under stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:09] Alexia: Yeah. Yeah. And it's not gonna work. So you really have to find that balance. And if you are an anxious person, Then it is practicing things like mindfulness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:20] Alexia: It is maybe doing some meditation. It is maybe talking things out or however it is. I love baking, bake. If it's I love knitting, I knit. If it's I love reading, read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:31:33] Alexia: What whatever the other thing is to kind of Balance yours. You need to do, like, therapeutic things to balance that out. I I would say, though, with me, it has been kind of experience. And Even now if I get a cold, it's it's it's still upsetting. You you know, it's still upsetting when, you know, the voice is not Happy, it's still upsetting, but it's about talking yourself off the ledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:01] Alexia: You've gotta talk yourself off the ledge. Okay. Hold on. I say it to myself. Have you had a cold before?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:08] Alexia: Yes. This is literally the question you have to ask. Have I had a cold before? Yes. Did you get better?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:15] Alexia: Yes. And then that you might have the little mean man on the other shoulder thing. Yeah. But took you a really long time. But did you get over it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:21] Alexia: Yes. You have to keep on reminding yourself, this too shall pass. It's not here forever. It will pass, But you have to be patient in the season of waiting. You weren't meant to be there today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:35] Alexia: You weren't meant to do that gig. Leave it alone. And it's hard to find peace with that, especially when sometimes when you want to really do something or maybe somebody was doing the gig, but you'd really love to do that. You have to learn sometimes That was not for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:48] Claire: And and how do you cope with exterior pressures?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:32:51] Claire: Once once you've got your own head Mhmm. Set straight about, no, this isn't for me, um, I need this time. How do you then cope with the pressures from outside saying, well, you gotta do it or couldn't you it sounded okay last night. Come back on to &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:04] Alexia: Boundaries. You have to put your boundaries in in place because people like to think of you as being a diva just because you're saying no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:11] Alexia: Right? But it's not about that. It's about boundaries. Because if I'm not okay, then I can't go out there and do my best. So I have to create boundaries of what is this is too much for me because, ultimately, you're the 1 who's left to have to pick up the pieces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:33:26] Alexia: So are you gonna do this thing of I'm not feeling particularly too well, I'm gonna do this concert, and because, you know, they they don't have anyone else, and it's it's last minute. I've got this cold the night before, and it's last minute. So, So, you know, like, I'm gonna push myself to this limit of doing this concert, and then they're just gonna say thank you, and then you're at home, and you're in bits, and you're in recovery for, what, the next 6 weeks. I think people don't really sometimes understand the mental of what that does. That is more scarring Sometimes almost then not being able to sing a few notes that you need maybe for the next 4 weeks Because you remember it, and it hurt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:07] Alexia: You know, the mental scarring is a lot. I think &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:10] Oren: that's why the voice It's so different to any other musical instrument. It is an instrument, but you can replace a piano. You can replace You can't &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:20] Alexia: replace a voice. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:21] Oren: It's &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:21] Alexia: treated Like it's replaced. Replaced. You can. No. They can replace you with somebody &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:28] Oren: See, that's the thing, isn't it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:30] Oren: From &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:30] Alexia: their perspective. Yeah. You can be replaced with somebody else. And I think that's what needs to be remembered. Like, you can't do that gig, it's okay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:36] Alexia: They will find someone else. Yeah. And you'll get better. And guess what? They have another gig in a few months' time, you'll be able to do that gig.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:44] Alexia: And don't get me wrong. You I have my moments. I just oh, I wish I could have done that. Yeah. You know, like, oh, it's a shame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:49] Alexia: That would have been really, really good. And you think about it, and the stews Ferment's there in the back. Right? Um, but then sometimes I'm like, my gosh. I'm really glad that did happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:34:57] Alexia: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like, That's really good that that actually didn't happen. Like, something was looking out for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:04] Alexia: I wonder whether there &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:05] Claire: might be people who are watching or listening who think, well, That's okay, you know, from the point of somebody a Grammy nominated, constantly working singer Can now say, I'm sorry. I have to pull out of that gig and has enough of a reputation to be able to then still be asked the next time. Do you think that's the luxury of Having had a long career, or is it something you could have done in your &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:28] Alexia: twenties? I should have done probably in my twenties. Um, I don't think it has pushed me along for through at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:35:36] Alexia: Because like I've said before, what's for you is for you, and it will not pass you. It's for me, it's already written. Just because you're not able to have done that gig doesn't mean that it's not maybe gonna come for you later on in life. Who put it on their Insta the other day? Someone put a post on their Insta the other day about having auditioned for something when a show came out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:36:00] Alexia: They didn't get the gig, and they were so gutted. But now, years later, they have got this gig and the understanding now that they weren't ready then Yeah. For that gig. Yeah. They can Appreciate the journey in between because they've learned all the other stuff in between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:36:20] Alexia: So maybe you want that gig. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. And And you're like, oh, I'm ill, but if I just push through but why would you go along? Let's say if it was an audition, sing, then remember you having a sore throat, etcetera, And not being able to do it very well than just pulling out and saying, I'll audition another time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:36:40] Alexia: You can learn so much in between anyway If, you know, like, in between that time, doing other stuff, whether it's concerts, whether it's workshops, whether it's whatever it is. And all of that It's literally building you up for the very thing that you want. As much as it's like, oh, But you're Grammy nominated and, you know, like, you're working and stuff. There are moments where I'm not working. It doesn't all just flood in for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:05] Alexia: I still have to audition like the next Farson, I'm not do you know do you know what I mean? Like, you've got to listen. You've got to come first. You cannot pour into anything if your tank is empty. You just cannot do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:17] Alexia: It's physically impossible, and it's only a matter of time where &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:22] Claire: And have you been there? Have you been where your tank is Empty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:26] Alexia: Yeah. I've been in a place where my tank is empty, and I've constantly sacrificed myself. And I would say it is Almost something like the pandemic that has made me say, hold on a second.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:37:45] Alexia: How am I expecting to do this If I'm not okay. And I think, again, it's okay if you're not okay. There is a mentality that it's not okay if you're if you're not okay. It's not okay. No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:00] Alexia: It's okay if you're not okay. This too shall pass. This is not for you right now. You are human. Just like all the other people who are, like, creating these jobs for all these shows and all these gigs and, you know, all these casting directors are They get colds too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:18] Alexia: They have to go off what to. Do you know what I mean? It's just unfortunate that maybe when you got your cold, It's fallen in a time when you have this audition or the fact that you are a singer, a vocal athlete, where a cold will affect you differently. Somebody who does a 9 to 5 can sit down and be like, oh, I've had a cold for a couple of weeks. It's it's going, but it's kind of still there, and I'm a little bit I've still got a little bit of a cough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:43] Alexia: Unfortunately, that might knock you out instead for 6. Yeah. And that's the reality. And I think there is a mentality of, Even pre pandemic, you can get a cold and it can knock you out for 8. 8 weeks, it can knock you out 4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:38:58] Alexia: And it's unfortunate. And it, Don't get me wrong. You fall you bang your head against the wall. I'm not saying like, oh, it's fine. You just sit down for 8 weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:06] Alexia: No. Of course, you're going to stir crazy. 100 percent, you're going to stir crazy because you wanna get back out then. You wanna be doing what you love and, you know, like, being creative. We're creative beings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:17] Alexia: You know, you have to ride the tide. And if you're frustrated, get those frustrations out. You know? But there's no point in Trying to do something before you're ready to, before your body's ready to, because you're coming back, what, 50 percent better? How long before you get knocked out again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:35] Alexia: It's a countdown. It's okay. You got through this 1. Okay. You got through that 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:39] Alexia: I'm getting a bit tired now. No. I can't do 3. That's a laugh. Then you're in this stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:45] Alexia: And then that's a whole other mental game. You have to pick almost like your You're poison. You know? Yeah. You have to pick, and you have to make a decision to say, hold on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:39:56] Alexia: Actually, I'm not okay. Me taking This little time off where it doesn't feel hundred percent alright, and I know that I'm pushing myself to achieve something It's not worth it because the aftermath of that and what I'm gonna have to deal with apart from me getting myself back In a good vocal place, it's the mental and the emotional and the spiritual of what that does to you. There are so many layers. It's beyond the sound that you're able to produce because, again, the Sound is connected to you emotionally. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:37] Alexia: Any &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:38] Claire: disagreement? Either of us at all. You were talking earlier about how you build a character. Uh-huh. How much of yourself is present in that character, and how much do you give up Yourself for the character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:40:52] Alexia: Oh, good 1. Um, I think there's always an element of yourself In a character because it's coming from your lens, even if it's I don't know if you were to be playing. I don't know. Let's say a a drug addict. Let's say for the sake of it, it's a bit bit extreme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:06] Alexia: I have been watching I have been watching all the the crazy things on Netflix lately. So that's probably why I've come out a lot of the track. It It would still be your perspective and your lens of how you're perceiving how a drug drug addict would how they feel in that moment, they can tell you, but it's still your lens. So there's always gonna be an element of yourself, I think, within The character. How much I give up of myself was the next part of it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:40] Alexia: I think you do. You I think you have to fully surrender to fully immerse yourself Into a character. Otherwise, there are still too many elements of yourself, and then you're not really being Authentically. And is is that does &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:41:58] Claire: that then come into the being present? Is that 1 of the prerequisites for being present?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:04] Claire: Yeah. Hundred So do you have tricks for getting yourself to that place when maybe you don't feel like it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:10] Alexia: Sometimes I do watch things or, You know, like, listen to things that would help with the character. Like, I remember when I was doing, um, Navalungi, it was Looking at the research around, you know, a young African girl Who's living in poverty. And though it was a comedy, it doesn't have to be a dramatic piece in order for you to it's it's always important, the layering of character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:42:37] Alexia: But then also the innocence In the mind. And so it was like, I almost used my nieces for that innocence, That wide eyed is to actually believe it. To and it's so hard almost to be young again because We're tainted. Not genuine. But, you know, like It's true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:01] Alexia: But, you know, like, we we the the the our The innocence gets lost as we get kind of older Yeah. Because we see what reality has kind of shown us. So it's like To try and delve into that and as much as possible, let go into that belief that The to believe, like, to fully let go and truly think that there is this place called Salt Lake City. Like, really believe it, and that's what makes it funny. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:35] Alexia: Yes? Yeah. Yeah. Without question. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:43:37] Alexia: You know? If I don't believe that So Talladega City is real, then you ain't gonna believe it. You're gonna know that I'm just along for the fun ride of But if I believe it and that innocence in my nieces of believing things Yeah. You know, like and when you tell them, like, you're, like, you're just teasing them or something, Really aren't I'm seeing that in their eyes, that genuine thing, that innocence that a child has. It's like I had to do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:05] Alexia: I had to pick almost a bit from them. A lot. Sorry. You &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:08] Claire: keep taking a breath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:10] Alexia: Oh, my question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:11] Alexia: My question. Okay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:13] Claire: Last 1 Mhmm. That goes alongside that Is you have played some really iconic roles and roles that are in the, you know, the big shows where there's a new person Every 1 or 2 years playing that role. How do you deal with slipping into those roles?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:31] Claire: How do you manage? How much of you comes into that? Do you think it's important that you have a new interpretation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:36] Alexia: What 100 percent. I think it's incredibly important for you to have your own There's no point in you trying to be like Jane on Broadway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:43] Alexia: You're not Jane. It's 1 of the things that I constantly preach whenever a young person asks me, You know, like, oh, how do I deal with this? Or how do I do you've got to be authentically yourself. You are not going to sing sing like Bernadette Peters. Don't try and sing it like her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:44:57] Alexia: You're not going to act like, I don't know, um, via via the Davis or, you know, Mara Streep. Don't you've got to be authentically yourself. Only then can you be the best That you can physically be. Having taken over from, like, lots of people in different roles and things like that, I don't think I've ever felt like I had to be like The person who was before, which I'm kind of grateful for. The whole point, I think, of, like, harsh changes is is that we get to see another lens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:23] Alexia: What's the point if you're trying to it's that same thing of, like, that square, trying to getting into that circle. Yeah. It just doesn't fit. You know, you're not that person. You evoke different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:36] Alexia: Your lens is different. Your life is different. Your background's different. So you're going to bring something different to the table. And that is the beauty of being able to see all these shows that have been running for so many years, A different lens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:52] Alexia: And that's why it's then sometimes like, oh, that's a new perspective. I never thought of it in that way. You're talking about being &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:45:58] Oren: authentically yourself in that moment. And and by that moment, I'm saying, like, for the period of that production, that's Yeah. But you've done some roles where you've come back into it years later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:10] Oren: Yeah. What's Is there a difference there between the previous authentic self and current authentic self? 100 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:15] Alexia: percent. My lens is different because my life experience has happened between that time. Um, comes with age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:26] Alexia: Um, you do. And and and it's when you're younger, you hear, like, oh, yeah. People always say that. You know, like, oh, it comes with a and it it does. In in the nicest possible way, it Re it really does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:46:39] Alexia: And only when you get there can you look back and truly see it. It's not that your, Um, your perspective is invalid when you were younger, because what you have been through up to that point in your life is valid. But The way you sometimes even just in life, like, the way you will handle something when you're in your, I don't know, teens versus when you're even in your late Twenties is gonna be different. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:06] Oren: Which is so interesting, isn't it? Because it's the same character Yep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:10] Oren: That is the same age of character, But you're coming into it with new experiences Yeah. That then reinforce Yeah. That same character, which I think is so fascinating because you're playing The same thing Yeah. Potentially very different ways Yeah. From not just yourself, but now &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:26] Alexia: from everybody else that we Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:27] Alexia: You're you're just a you're just a different Person. You're not nobody's the same as they were when they were 18. Your life experiences teaches you that. You know, you learn so much along the way, and that isn't Just in your career, but just in life, in family, in friends, in all of that stuff. Even when you're just going to do your normal shop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:47:50] Alexia: Like like, you do you learn different things along the way, And it teaches you. So life is almost part of the teacher of you being able to be a better artist, Better creatively have a wider perspective as opposed to 1 that will be a lot more narrow. When you're younger, your perspective widens as you get older. How &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:15] Claire: do you feel looking back on previous incarnations of roles that you've reprised? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:20] Alexia: Like, oh, I wish I knew then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:24] Alexia: I do look Back in, oh, I wish I knew that. But then at the same time, I don't kind of really want to delve too much into it because that was then, And that was my reality then. Yeah. Yeah. So you can't And also, I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:37] Claire: think that's something for as much as we're saying as you grow older, you learn more, which It's absolutely true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:42] Claire: Mhmm. There was also a magic to The innocence. The innocence and not knowing that we'll have brought something to that role as well. Point. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:50] Claire: So So &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:48:50] Alexia: you can be really comfortable about Yeah. It's like a new person who's been able to, you know, um, and as much as it feels familiar, it's unfamiliar because You do just feel differently about it. You do look at it differently. We looked at it &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:03] Claire: vocally differently Yeah. As well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:05] Claire: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've looked at, you know, what happens with the voice? How does the voice morph A hundred percent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:10] Claire: And how can it be expressed Yeah. In &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:12] Alexia: this new in this new, yeah, new way? I would love to see &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:16] Oren: a side by side recording. No. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:18] Alexia: No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:18] Alexia: No. No. No. No. No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:19] Alexia: No. Don't do that. Don't do that. Nightmare. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:25] Oren: I think it would be so informative to look at that and and I expect, like, you know, I'm thinking about students studying it and understanding those 2 different Mindsets and perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:34] Oren: I think this thing would be really cool. Yeah. Don't It's a shame. I mean, there probably is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:44] Claire: So we're gonna ask Lexi about her 5 minute call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:46] Claire: We &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:47] Oren: are indeed. And what's this? We are really curious as to what your 5 minute call is. What what's Do you have a routine? Do you do anything in particular at your 5 minute call?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:55] Oren: I &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:49:55] Alexia: would almost say at the half is when I start. I need calm. I can't have frantic around me. This is something, again, I've learned, um, And against that boundaries thing, um, before I would never say no, and I'd allow people to Just be my space, and I'd go out on stage and you're just angst. Whereas now, I need the calm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:50:20] Alexia: And then I might just do a a few little exercises again just to, yep, she's fine. Sizes again just to yep. She's fine. And ironically, it's hearing Claire's voice that Sometimes also puts me in check. That's it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:50:35] Alexia: You know? It's remembering it's just like going over and remembering this is what your voice is today. You know, you adapt, you pivot, and there's nothing wrong with your voice. It's just sometimes we we can Mentally, sometimes hold on to what you want it to sound like Mhmm. As well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:50:53] Alexia: Mhmm. Um, I wanna sound like this, and I wanna evoke this, and I wanna, But it's just to say, this is you today. Be present in the moment. And also I go over, like, any notes and things that I've maybe been given, and just truly think about them and, like, also give myself grace in that it's okay if I don't get the note in 1. Do you know what I mean?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:19] Alexia: Like, that it might take time because I need to make it feel normal, but then I'm not perfect. Sometimes I do tailspin. I was saying it the other day. I'm like, I'm tailspinning. Do you know what I mean?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:30] Alexia: Yeah. Like, I do tailspinning. It's like to somehow get off the ledge. And it it it takes time, but my my 5 minute thing is probably just a couple of exercises And just like a bit of chill. Chill, think about a couple of notes, and just very relax it has to be relaxed So that when I walk down, I'm not in this high anxiety place before going out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:51:58] Claire: Actually 1 of the other shows I work on, we instigated, uh, notices on the dressing room door thing for people who wanted that quiet time Yeah. At the half because it can become so frenetic. It can. And saying no to it You feel groovy. You see the bit of Friction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:14] Claire: Yeah. So I'm just just having a notice saying, and it was fine, you know, so I'll knock and do the approval of that. That's that's fine. But Yeah. You're allowed your own space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:23] Claire: Yeah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:24] Alexia: It's and so the thing is, that's not necessarily for everyone. Some people need the energy around them. Yeah. It kind of, I guess, fires them up for their show maybe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:35] Alexia: Um, but for me, I just I just need to feel, like, settled before I go out just so that my head is clear. Otherwise, I just feel like I'm in a high anxiety place, and I feel like my head feels muddy Almost, um, going out there. So I just I do just, like, have a little bit of, like, okay. Do a couple of those Lovely. Fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:52:58] Alexia: Okay. That's good. Today, this is what it is. Do the best you can. Be present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:03] Alexia: That's all you can do. That's all you can do for today. Yeah. I love it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:10] Claire: We have 1 other thing for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:11] Claire: Yes. We do &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:12] Alexia: indeed. Scary. So Oh my gosh. We ask Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:19] Alexia: All &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:19] Oren: of our previous guests to write a question in this book How about that goes completely unseen by everybody We have not seen it. Until I now read this question to you, and then you get to answer the question, and then you get to write 1 of your own for the next guest. So there's a question in this book that none of us know, and I'm gonna read it to you now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:37] Alexia: Goodness. I'm scared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:41] Claire: Oh, 0, this is lovely. So this is, has there been someone who has been your greatest support, dead or alive, And given the opportunity, what would you say to them to let them know how special they are and how grateful you are? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:53:54] Alexia: Don't make me cry. No. It's Bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:02] Alexia: The person who has been the absolute Constant in my life, um, my rock is my bum. She's wiped my tears. She's been there when I've been low, Um, and she supported from a young age. Like I said, like, from figure skating to dance classes to, Like, just exercising things that were of interests to me, to her teaching me to bake, to her teaching me to knit. I mean, like, literally, I used to knit my dolls' school jumpers because my mom was knitting my school jumper Alongside she is my rock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:54:49] Alexia: I love her fiercely, and I don't think I would be where I am today Nor have the mindset and be able to cope with, um, the adversities that I have come up against Within my career, within life, um, without her, she is a phenomenal woman, Lorna Facey. And she's on a cruise right now. Yes. Yeah. She's, um, she's phenomenal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:25] Alexia: She has just been everything to me. Everything. Um, she's even tried to do reading scripts with me, bless her. She's like, this isn't really my thing, but, you know, Um, like, she's she's phenomenal. She she she really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:55:40] Claire: It's such a great question though, isn't it? Because it is so important that they're, I mean, I consider myself very fortunate that I actually have quite a lot of people who I can take my thoughts to and trust in their opinions. But, Um, I was just listening to a podcast on the way in this morning with Richard Branson Yeah. Saying he it was always his dad for him, and now his dad's passed, it's his daughter. Yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:03] Claire: There's just that there's that person who you can go to Yeah. And and just hear your thoughts out loud. Yeah. And &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:10] Alexia: My mom's like she's she's honest in a good way. You know, like, even when I'm, like, I'm singing stuff, she's like, no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:15] Alexia: That's not it. You know? But she could she's it's funny. She's not a singer, but she would hear if I'm pushing. She would hear if I haven't attacked something correct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:25] Alexia: Like, she's, like, She's got the ear. Yeah. I'll give her that. She's got the girl's got the ear. Um, but, like, yeah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:34] Alexia: No. She is definitely Person. She is my person for for literally everything. Like, I can't think of any 1 thing, and she's got great understanding. Like I said, my mom doesn't My mom works in finance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:56:45] Alexia: Do you know what I mean? Like, she doesn't she's not at all within the industry, but has, Um, allowed herself to have great understanding for my good I mean, she understands them like mama on vocal rest. They get it. Like, you know, Um, and I think it's all of her support, you know, like, where she's even helped the family to to kind of understand it, and they and they get it. My family, I'm I'm blessed in that respect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:11] Alexia: They get it because I'm really strict about that stuff, you know, like, I'm on vocal rest. My nieces even know. I mean, I've even got, like, signs, like, now where they're like, oh, no. Our sex on Vogue arrest, you I know what she's saying. I'll go and get that for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:22] Alexia: Do you know what I mean? Like, like, they know. Do you know what I mean? Like, it's just been something that she's been able to kind of create this space of safety, but, yeah, no. She's awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:32] Alexia: Yeah. The most &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:33] Oren: beautiful answer to &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:34] Alexia: that question. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[00:57:37] Claire: So thank you so much for sharing your time with us and for telling us your thoughts.
